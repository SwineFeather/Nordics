### 🛶 **The Saga of Nyrvalos – “The Crossing”**

> _They say the sea gives and the sea takes. But there comes a tide once in an age, when the sea does neither. It simply... opens._
>
> From the north they came—eight ships adrift in fog. Their hulls battered, their sails torn, yet their banners still flew. These were no warbands or raiders. These were townsmen, traders, farmers, hunters. A fleet of those who once called a place _Nordhjem_, now lost beyond memory.
>
> Towns like **Othandra**, **Kalavala**, **Vikenha**, and **Hansan** sent their best—some by hope, others by exile. One ship bore the mark of **Ligancity**, another whispered of **Ostrevy**, and some still speak of the ghost-ship from the **Emerald Sea**, vanishing and reappearing in the mist.
>
> The world they left was one of ice, pine, and stone. It had been their home for two long winters—but it was never meant to last. The land cracked. The stars dimmed. Whispers rose on the winds. So they left. Not as conquerors, but as _survivors_. Carried not by charts or oaths, but by an instinct deep and older than blood:
>
> _**There is something across the sea.**_
>
> And so they crossed—and the sea opened. A storm broke, and with it, the sky. Their ships were torn apart not by waves, but by _change_. When the waters calmed, they found themselves ashore—not in ice, not in pine—but in strange, warm lands of golden mist and tall, unnatural trees.
>
> _**This is Nyrvalos.**_
>
> A world untouched by their past. A realm of vast continents, old magic, and waiting gods. The names are new, but the heart is not. For they did not leave behind their old world... they are its _carriers_.
>
> Now, they plant new banners in lands like **Ashendell**, **Brigantia**, and **Shadowmere**. But they remember. In toasts, in stories, in the way they build their towns just _so_. In how they light their fires and forge their tools. These settlers are no longer from the Old World—but they are its echoes.
>
> And when they die, and their children grow beneath twin moons and magic stars, some will still ask:
>
> _"What lies beyond the mist?"_
>
> And the sea will answer. Someday.
