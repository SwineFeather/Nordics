_(Slow, gravelly tone. Nordic ambiance in background—sea wind, creaking wood, distant gulls)_

> **"They say the sea gives... and the sea takes.**\
> &#xNAN;_(short pause)_\
> But once in an age... it opens.
>
> From the frozen north, they came—eight ships, carved in haste, hardened by winter winds.\
> Their sails were torn. Their hulls cracked.\
> But their banners flew. Still.
>
> Othandra... Kalavala... Vikenha...\
> Hansan Traders. Ligancity. Ostrevy...\
> Even the Emerald Sea’s ghost-ship—half-legend, half-shadow—followed in their wake.
>
> They called their old world _Nordhjem_.\
> Cold. Harsh. Brief.\
> But home.
>
> Then the stars dimmed. The earth cracked.\
> Something whispered across the waves.
>
> _“There is another shore...”_
>
> So they crossed—not for conquest...\
> ...but for survival.
>
> And the sea answered.
>
> A storm without wind. A sky without light.\
> And then—calm.
>
> Before them stretched a strange land. Golden light. Towering trees. Forgotten names.
>
> _**Nyrvalos.**_\
> The breath between realms.
>
> They do not understand it.\
> But they remember.
>
> In how they light their fires.\
> In how they build their homes.\
> In the old songs they hum in the fields.
>
> They are not of this world.\
> But they are _its beginning_.
>
> And so the new age dawns—\
> Not with a sword.\
> But with a step...\
> ...onto unfamiliar soil."

Billy the voice-line seems to be very nice. In the studio you can adjust pitch and add pauses.
