# 1.1.9

**Update:** _The following changes will take effect after the server restart at 5:00 AM_

* Upkeep is now determined by the number of protected plots, with each protected plot contributing €0.4 to the upkeep cost.
* Replaced the €10 flat fee upkeep for Towns with a €5 minimum upkeep.
* Increased the limit of protected plot additions for residents from 8 to 16 plots.
* Reduced the plot purchase price from €25 to €5 per plot.
* Unclaiming plots now refunds half of the purchase price, allowing for more fluid borders.
* Added custom crafting recipe for Bottle o' Enchanting.
* Striders don't drop money anymore, as they're neutral mobs.

The values may be adjusted in the future to maintain balance.
