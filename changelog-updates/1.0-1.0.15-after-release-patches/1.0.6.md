# 1.0.6

**Minor update**

* Fire spread is now enabled. Please report back to me if it causes any performance issues, so I can look into slowing it down or limiting it in some way. Please make sure that your town has fire spread enabled, for fire to spread in its protected areas.
* Security patch.
