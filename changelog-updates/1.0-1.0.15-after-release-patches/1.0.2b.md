# 1.0.2b

**Follow-up update:**

* Taking damage within a 10-second window now interrupts the Town teleportation process.
* Movement within the 10-second window also halts the Town teleportation process.
* Reduced minimum plot distance between towns from 5 to 2. However, it also needs to be at least 3 chunks from the other town’s homeblock, which is its center.
* Cooldown for toggling PVP in a Town is now increased from 30 to 60 seconds.
* Increased respawn protection from 10 to 30 seconds. Note that players who attack other players will immediately lose their protection.
* Towns can have up to 30 residents without being in a nation.
* Towns now have automatic capitalization.
* Actually enabled player map visibility by default. Visibility can be hidden at any time using `/dynmap hide`, or enabled again by `/dynmap show`.
