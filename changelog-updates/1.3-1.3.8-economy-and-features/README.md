**New Rules:** _We recently discovered that client mods can cause crashes for players without any errors specified in the console. Therefore we would like to clarify our rules regarding the use of client mods_

* **Client mods**
  * Players are prohibited from using client mods that are known to cause server crashes or instability. Any client mods that have the potential to disrupt the server/player performance or cause crashes are strictly forbidden. Any concerns about specific mods should be brought to the attention of the server administrators for evaluation and approval before use.
* **Redstone rules**

> * Passive and Active redstone farms
>
> Active redstone machines are not allowed; however, passive machines are permitted with restrictions. They must not exceed 2 chunks in size, be stacked higher than 2 units, and should only be activated by observers, daylight sensors, or a player. Avoid constant activation of triggers, as it is considered active redstone.
>
> * Large scale redstone farms
>
> Each town allows only one large-scale farm (except for bamboo and kelp farms), limited to 5 by 5 chunks on a single layer. Redstone components must stay within 20% of the total farm area and operate solely on player-initiated power. Prohibited are redstone clocks, daylight sensors, and continuous triggers; instead, a button press initiates one cycle of operation.
>
> * Redstone machinery
>
> Non-farm-related redstone machines are welcome, provided they don't put undue strain on the server.



&#x20;**New Port and Host**  We are pleased to inform you that the server migration is now complete! You can join the server using the same IP, but make sure to add the port **:25612** to the IP address. The Dynmap will however take a day to complete its render. This new hosting change will significantly extend the lifespan of our server, as it has effectively reduced the monthly cost by half. This means we can continue to provide a stable and enjoyable Minecraft experience. See you in the game, and a big thank you for your support, with special appreciation to our patrons on: [https://www.patreon.com/nordics](https://www.patreon.com/nordics)
