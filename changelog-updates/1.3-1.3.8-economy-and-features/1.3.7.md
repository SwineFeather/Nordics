# 1.3.7

* **Hotfix**
  * You can now enable default fishing through `/lfish catalog`
  * Town upkeep reduced, from `0.3` to `0.2`
  * Dynmap chat enabled, it will remember your IP so no register needed, but if it doesn't work use command `/dynmap webregister` ingame.
  * `/dynmap URL` will return the user a link to the dynmap
