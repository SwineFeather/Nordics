# 1.3.5

&#x20;**New Port and Host**  We are pleased to inform you that the server migration is now complete! You can join the server using the same IP, but make sure to add the port **:25612** to the IP address. The Dynmap will however take a day to complete its render. This new hosting change will significantly extend the lifespan of our server, as it has effectively reduced the monthly cost by half. This means we can continue to provide a stable and enjoyable Minecraft experience. See you in the game, and a big thank you for your support, with special appreciation to our patrons on: [https://www.patreon.com/nordics](https://www.patreon.com/nordics)
