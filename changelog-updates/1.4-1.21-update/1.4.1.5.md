## Discord Post

Here's the latest updates!

#### **Nation and Town Changes:**

* **NationZones:**\

  * These new areas function like wilderness, but only nation members can modify them. As nations grow, NationZones expand, starting from 1 chunk and increasing to 6 chunks as populations rise. The capital town of each nation benefits from an even larger NationZone, helping to prevent griefing around towns.
* **Peaceful Cost Modifier (Coming Soon):**\
  While not active yet (due to the war system being disabled), there will be a peaceful cost modifier that starts at 5 euros for towns and 15 euros for nations. This cost increases as towns and nations grow, up to a 30% increase in cost.
* **Upkeep Adjustments:**\
  We’ve reduced the upkeep for both towns and nations:\

  * **Town upkeep** is now **40% lower** at 0.12 per plot.
  * **Nation upkeep** is now **30% lower** at 0.07 per plot.
* **Outpost Limits:**\
  The number of outposts a town can have is now capped, but as your town and nation grow, you’ll be able to unlock more. For full details, visit: [Outpost Info](https://wiki.nordics.world/guides-and-commands/server-configs).

#### **Server Upgrade and BlueMap:**

* **Server Upgrade to 1.21.1:**\
  We’ve upgraded to **Minecraft 1.21.1** and moved to a new server host, giving us more flexibility and allowing for future features.
* **BlueMap Transition:**\
  We’ve switched from Dynmap to **BlueMap**, unlocking tons of new possibilities. With BlueMap, we’ve added:
  * **Wiki links** in every town’s popup box.
  * Markers for **ruined towns**, **monuments**, and **large buildings**.
  * Lore-based markers featuring texts and sometimes images to help preserve key locations on the server. These changes help keep the history of Nordics alive for all players.

#### **Trello Is Live:**

Our **Public Trello board** is now available for tracking suggestions, bug reports, and ongoing projects. You can find all active changes there and get instant updates, rather than relying on Discord announcements, which may take weeks to come out. **How You Can Get Involved:**

* **Submit Ideas & Reports:** Add your ideas or bug reports in the "New Reports" list to help shape the future of the server.
* **Vote:** Vote on suggestions to influence the priority of upcoming features.
* **Contribute:** If you’re looking to get more involved, you can also help with projects.

#### **Future Updates:**

* **Fishing Update:**\
  The **Fishing Update** is scheduled to release around October. It’s going to bring exciting new features, so keep an eye out!
* **War Update:**\
  The upcoming War system will favor **PvP players** and introduce a new layer of excitement for combat enthusiasts. Rest assured, your town won’t be griefed or destroyed—any damage will be kept to a minimum to ensure fairness and protect the hard work of builders. The release of this system will depend on player activity and may launch either after the Fishing Update or with the next major content drop.

#### **Server Rules:**

As always, remember that the official **server rules** are maintained on the wiki. For any questions about rules, visit: [Server Rules](https://wiki.nordics.world/general-information/rules-and-moderation/rules), or use the search function on the wiki to get instant answers.
