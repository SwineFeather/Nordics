# ðŸ—½ Statue of Liberty

On St. Petersburg Island in the Finland Region stands a unique copper statue, the result of months of work by Occypolojee. The idea came to life around [**December 10th**](../../../../server-dates/december-23.md#dec-10), with the foundation set by **December 14th**, and after plenty of dedication, the statue was finished on [**February 24th, 2024**.](../../../../server-dates/february-24.md#feb-24)

What makes this statue special isnâ€™t just its size, but the story behind it. Occypolojee spent countless hours mining the **3,372 copper blocks**â€”thatâ€™s **52.7 stacks**â€”needed to build it. He discovered that the best copper veins were found along the western coast of Norway, and much of the material came from those coastal mines. Now, the statue stands tall, a reflection of all the hard work and copper that went into it.
