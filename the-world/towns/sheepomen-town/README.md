Sheepomen Town is a recently established town located beside one of the largest wheat fields on the server. One of the notable landmarks of Sheepomen Town is a structure named "the bird" which was constructed by Adamism1.

Initially, the town was established in a cave adjacent to the wheat farm. Later on, Adamism1 added several buildings to the town, and it continues to expand to this day.
