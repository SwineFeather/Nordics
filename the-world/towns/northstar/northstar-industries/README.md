# Northstar Industries

Northstar Industries was founded by the residents of Northstar shortly after the town's conception. The purpose for the company was to grow Northstars industrial influence and salespower across the world. Its placement was perfect for becoming an important trade point, the first marketplace was placed right in the center of town and had rentable plots to outsiders and Northmen. This let new companies form such as Mora Trä, Kabbe2121’s Disk shop and Aquashore wagon.

Today Northstar Industries is more of a parent company and now has multiple divisions that work in specific areas. The organization now mostly works with marketing and trade connections with towns within the nation and outside.
