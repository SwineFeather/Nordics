<summary><strong>Background History</strong></summary>

<br>

**Sogndalsfjorden** was founded on **12 April 2025** by the **Fjordians**, a nomadic people originally from the **Eurasian Steppe**. Driven from their homeland by **Mongol invasions**, they migrated westward for many years under the leadership of **Kapakka** and **Arzi Fjord**.

The Fjordians brought with them a unique culture marked by their guttural language, **Fjorik**, as well as a diet of sweet berries, and rich oral traditions. Their settlement in the Norwegian fjords marks the end of their nomadic history and the beginning of a new chapter.

According to legend, their arrival fulfills an ancient prophecy known as **"The Steindrøm"**—a vision of a rebirth in a cold land surrounded by mist and stone. Some claim seeing a mysterious **black eagle** found near the camp is tied to this prophecy, though its origin remains unknown.

Today, **Sogndalsfjorden** stands as the spiritual and cultural foundation of the reborn Fjordian people.
