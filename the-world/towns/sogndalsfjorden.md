<summary><strong>Background History</strong></summary>

<br>

**Sogndalsfjorden** was founded on **12 April 2025** by the **Fjordians**, a nomadic people originally from the **Eurasian Steppe**. Driven from their homeland by **Mongol invasions**, they migrated westward for many years under the leadership of **Kapakka** and **Arzi Fjord**.

The Fjordians brought with them a unique culture marked by their guttural language, **Fjorik**, as well as a diet of sweet berries, and rich oral traditions. Their settlement in the Norwegian fjords marks the end of their nomadic history and the beginning of a new chapter.

According to legend, their arrival fulfills an ancient prophecy known as **"The Steindrøm"**—a vision of a rebirth in a cold land surrounded by mist and stone. Some claim seeing a mysterious **black dwarf** near the camp that is tied to this prophecy, though its origin remains unknown.

Today, **Sogndalsfjorden** stands as the spiritual and cultural foundation of the reborn Fjordian people.

The **Founding Era**, known in Fjorik as **Tuldrenn Nahrkar** (*“Age of Founding Stone”*), marks the first official period in the history of **Sogndalsfjorden**. It began with the initial settlement of the Fjordians in southern Norway following their long migration from the Eurasian Steppe.

This era is characterized by the transition from a **nomadic lifestyle** to a **settled society**. The Fjordians began establishing the foundations of their town, constructing early **stone houses**, **statues**, **inns**, and **underground complexes**, all while maintaining their cultural identity. During this time, **trade routes** were opened with distant lands such as **Ireland** and **Sweden**, allowing for the exchange of resources and knowledge.

Economically, the settlement saw the development of a **primitive but stable system of trade and labor**, including **resource gathering**, **crafting**, and **bartering**. Though small, the town quickly became self-sustaining and began attracting attention as a new and distinct cultural enclave.

Spiritually and culturally, the Founding Era is also a time of **revival**. **Ancient traditions**, **language**, and **beliefs** were reasserted, and the mysterious **Black Dwarf** — discovered near the heart of the valley — became a symbol of **prophecy and guidance** for many.
