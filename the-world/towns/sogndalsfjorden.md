## Background History

Sogndalsfjorden was founded on 12 April 2025 by the Fjordians, a nomadic people originally from the Eurasian Steppe. Driven from their homeland by Mongol invasions, they migrated westward for many years under the leadership of Kapakka and Arzi Fjord.

The Fjordians brought with them a unique culture marked by their guttural language, **Fjorik**, as well as a diet of sweet berries, and rich oral traditions. Their settlement in the Norwegian fjords marks the end of their nomadic history and the beginning of a new chapter.

According to legend, their arrival fulfills an ancient prophecy known as **"The Steindrøm"**—a vision of a rebirth in a cold land surrounded by mist and stone. Some claim seeing a mysterious black eagle found near the camp is tied to this prophecy, though its origin remains unknown.

Today, Sogndalsfjorden stands as the spiritual and cultural foundation of the reborn Fjordian people.
