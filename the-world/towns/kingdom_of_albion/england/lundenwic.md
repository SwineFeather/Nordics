## Background

Lundenwic was created on [August 13, 2024](../../../../server-dates/august-24.md#aug-13), by Tatataat. The town is situated on the eastern part of the [British Isles](../../archived-towns/british-isles-region/), with an outpost in the Northeast known as Jorvik. The main town is located in the south of the mainland.

The main town is located on an island just off the coast, and there is an outpost nearby on the mainland.

The town was partly founded by [SeeYouMan](../../../players/seeyouman.md). It happened because [SeeYouMan](../../../players/seeyouman.md) wanted to try out Mjölner[^1]. With Tatataat reassured that the experience points would not be destroyed, [SeeYouMan](../../../players/seeyouman.md) went ahead and killed Tatataat. Everything went to plan and Tatataat could reclaim the experience points. However, during a second experiment, something went wrong and Tatataat could not reclaim the experience points. As a result, [SeeYouMan](../../../players/seeyouman.md) gifted Tatataat €250, thus partly founding the town.

## Rise and Transition in the North Sea League&#x20;

The town would eventually join the NSL and remain that way until Tatataat's disappearance causing the town to go into bankruptcy. Not wanting to lose a town and their claim on the British Isles the NSL would assign RiverPens as the new mayor of Lundenwic due to him already having a C.C.F.N trading outpost on the island known as Jorvik. On [February 9th, 2025](../../../../events-and-news/server-dates/february-25.md), RiverPens would be officially assigned as the new mayor of Lundenwic and start projects across the eastern coast of the island to improve it. Lundenwic would remain under RiverPens control until [April 28th, 2025](../../../../events-and-news/server-dates/april-25.md) when RiverPens and Danny\_boy95 would merge their two territories, uniting both England and Ireland into the Kingdom of Albion, with Danny\_boy95 acting as its King while RiverPens took the role of Duke of England.
