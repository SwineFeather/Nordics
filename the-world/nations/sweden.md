# Sweden

## Background

Sweden was founded by Elmureee, who also established and led Stockholm, the nation’s capital. To build Stockholm, Elmureee borrowed funds from NSL. Initially, Stockholm joined the Nation of Skyward Sanctum for support. Later, Elmureee abruptly left Skyward Sanctum to form the independent Nation of Sweden. This angered Skyward Sanctum’s leadership, who declared war on Sweden on April 20th, 2025. Sweden was quickly defeated and forced back into Skyward Sanctum’s control. Elmureee and Stockholm’s residents now wait for a chance to reclaim their independence.
