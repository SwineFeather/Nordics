_**Garvia:**_\
Bamson arrived in a newly made town with the name of Garvia where many of his former companions from Hansan settled. With much expectation and a bustling town, Bamson felt right at home. Quickly after entering the town, he began building and immersing himself in the town's development.

As a skilled builder and a mind for business, he set to work on his first building which was the Fishing hut. From previous knowledge, he knew how vital fishing was and wanted to create a cozy and welcoming place to catch fish.

After completing the first project, Bamson wanted to ensure Garvia's borders and connect Garvia with the rest of the server. It was done by making a gate at a highly used path going from North Karelia to Aquaria. As it was right in an intersection, he gave it the name [Cometfall Crossroads](../towns/garvia/cometfall-crossroads.md). Which became a safe and secure passage across the eastern side of the [Finland Region](../towns/archived-towns/finland-region/).

During the first days of the town. MineSkate planned and built the [Church of Garvia](../towns/garvia/church-of-garvia.md). Building a church alone was a challenging task, Bamson noticed the time it took to build it and felt that the church required some more detailing, so took the initiative to design the details.

In addition to these buildings, Bamson built the market, train station that was connected with Northstar, and the lighthouse along the coast of the northern island.

February 2024, Bamson rebuilt two town buildings and continued with the Cometfall Crossroads, featuring The Blazeheart Forge.
