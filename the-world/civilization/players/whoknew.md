WhoKnew joined the server for the first time on September 8, 2023, and co-founded the Pickle Empire on the first day of the server. WhoKnew left the server after the first day and would not join again until August 2024, during the [SÃ¡pmi forest fire](../../../server-events/terrain-incidents/the-sapmi-forest-fire.md).

On August 14, 2024, WhoKnew would found a new town called [Neko No Kuni](../towns/other-regions/neko-no-kuni.md).
