# C.C.F.N

The **C.C.F.N** or _Chambre des Commerces Franco-Norv√©gienne_ (French Norwegian Commerce Chamber) was created on[ October 25, 2024](../../../server-dates/october-24.md) by Aetzrak. The first settlement of the C.C.F.N is in Kristiansand Norway, where everything started. The location of the city was chosen because of the proximity to the sea making it easier to join other cities by boat thus making the city able to have a pier for future transactions.

The C.C.F.N joined the [NSL ](../nations/north-sea-league.md)on [January 7, 2025](../../../server-dates/january-25.md)

The [16 November 2024](../../../server-dates/november-24.md), Aetzrak decided it was time to make the second site of the C.C.F.N. the project of building France had begun. With the help of Volymskala he found the scale of france on the map and started outlining from then. First part filled up is Le Havre, then Higher Normandy. the project is massively helped by many other players and members of the [NSL](../nations/north-sea-league.md). with famous while filling being "F\*ckin Kelp"
