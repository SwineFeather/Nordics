After the announcement of the relaunch of the Nordic Union Minecraft server, the old Hansan Traders community began discussing the creation of a new town. There wasn't much planning before the server release, so when it opened, a group from the old [Hansan Traders](../../../../server-dates/the-2022-nordics-server/hansan-traders.md) community, alongside Aytte and MineSkate, decided to form the town of Garvia on September 10th, 2023.

Aytte and MineSkate were among the players who stayed on the old Nordic Union server the longest. Together with the old Hansan Traders community, they were a strong presence that kept the old server populated until it was shut down.

Today, Garvia is the community where the players of the old Nordic Union server came together to create a familiar home on the new, exciting server.

### History

### Lore

This is the tale of a place where faith and industry intertwine. A place where the echoes of history still whisper through the streets and gardens. It is a testament to the indomitable spirit of those who found their way to this land, carving a vibrant tapestry of life upon its sacred soil.

In a time long past, in a land steeped in mysticism and reverence, a sacred site lay untouched. It is here that the seeds of a remarkable story were sown. Upon this holy ground, the foundations of a humble church were laid. As the church rose from the earth, so did the first tentative farms, tended by dedicated priests and monks who had come to call this place home. With devotion and labor, they cultivated the land. breathing life into their spiritual haven. Yet, it was not just the pious who were drawn to this burgeoning sanctuary. As word spread of the fertile fields and bountiful blessings, others too were enticed by the promise of prosperity. Soon a harmonious community began to take shape. As the settlement prospered, its significance grew beyond the spiritual realm. To ease the passage of sea travelers, a grand canal was carved, offering a lifeline of commerce and connection. In its wake, a bustling harbor emerged, brimming with the riches of distant lands. But with growth came vulnerability and the threat of raids loomed ominously...
