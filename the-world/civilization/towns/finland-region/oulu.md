# Oulu



### History

#### [Oulu Massacre](broken-reference)

It was a chilling and dim night in the secluded coastal town of Oulu. A group of young and daring newcomers, with little to their names, had just arrived at the town's outskirts and sought refuge from the perils of the night. Suddenly, a forceful knock echoed through their cabin, and the door swung open, revealing a figure of medium stature, cloaked in shadow with a majestic, moonlit blue-hued armor. Startled by the stranger's appearance, the smallest of the group foolishly attempted to strike the man, despite his friends' warnings. His futile efforts only served to enrage the stranger, as his fist bounced off the armored chest. In one swift motion, the stranger's sword claimed the life of the angered man, sending the rest of the group into a panic. The man in shining armor turned his attention to the fleeing group, blinded by fury and showing no mercy. His sword fell on the innocent lives, one by one, as they sought to escape his terror.
