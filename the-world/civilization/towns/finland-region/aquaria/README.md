## History



### Breif Summary



### Founding of Aquaria

Aquaria is a town with a rich history that was founded by Jipes, Redapo, and the Kala Community. They worked together and received donations from the community to make it a reality. Before the server's launch, the community used tools like Google Maps to find the perfect location in Finland. Once the server was launched, players had to overcome challenges like dense forests and hostile mobs to reach the designated spot. But the community's spirit was unbroken, and they established and grew Aquaria.



### Initial Growth

Aquaria's early growth showcases the collaborative spirit and resourcefulness of its community. Each member chose a profession, such as farming, mining, forestry, etc., and farming quickly became a key element in addressing 0hunger in a challenging environment. The community worked tirelessly to establish farms and fishing spots, achieving significant milestones in meeting the town's sustenance needs.\
\
The community's efforts to improve fishing were especially impressive. They dug up riverbanks to access better loot, making fishing a source of food and a critical part of the town's economy. Members could trade fish for other resources. Meanwhile, the hardworking miners, led by Adamski, played a crucial role in driving the town's prosperity. Adamski became the top diamond gatherer on the server, providing much-needed resources for the community.\
\
As Aquaria grew, the need for a central hub for planning and meetings became apparent. The community's skilled builders rose to the challenge and constructed the town hall, which became the focal point for the expansion plans of the Kala Nation. Builder Serp's contributions were particularly noteworthy, elevating the town's aesthetic appeal and making it one of the most visually stunning towns on the server.\
\
Inspired by a collaborative spirit, the pioneering members of Aquaria sought to promote further growth by establishing connections with neighboring towns such as Muurmani and North Karelia. They blazed new trails, expanding Aquaria's reach within the server community and establishing it as a crucial regional player. Aquaria's impressive early growth was marked by diverse occupations and individual contributions, laying the groundwork for a prosperous community that would continue to thrive in the Nordics world.\

### Historic Events

#### Mending hunt

In Aquaria, the pursuit of the Mending Hunt was a thrilling activity that caught everyone's attention. Fishing became a significant pastime because the Kala people had a strong fishing tradition, and getting valuable loot from the sea was essential for players. The race to obtain the rare and highly sought-after Mending books became a fierce competition, and everyone wanted to be the first to get one.\
\
Mending books were so scarce that they had significant value, and everyone in Aquaria took up fishing to try and secure one. Players even built houses along the river to get the best fishing spots. The competition to fully outfit oneself with Mending-enchanted gear became a spirited race that consumed the inhabitants of Aquaria.\
\
In the early days of Aquaria, the Mending Book Hunt became a shared experience that brought players together. It was more than just enchantments; it was a communal effort that defined the server's early dynamics.\
