# Church of Garvia

MineSkate began planning and building the Church after the first day of the town. With inspiration from the church in Stockholm. Later on, Bamson took the initiative to help design the details of the church, including the exterior and the reflective mirrored floor. With help from Aytte and Eira as builders, the church was finally completed.
