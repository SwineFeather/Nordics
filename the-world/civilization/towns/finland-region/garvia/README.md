### History



### Lore

This is the tale of a place where faith and industry intertwine. A place where the echoes of history still whisper through the streets and gardens. It is a testament to the indomitable spirit of those who found their way to this land, carving a vibrant tapestry of life upon its sacred soil.

As the settlement prospered, its significance grew beyond the spiritual realm. To ease the passage of sea travelers, a grand canal was carved, offering a lifeline of commerce and connection. In its wake, a bustling harbor emerged, brimming with the riches of distant lands. But with growth came vulnerability and the threat of raids loomed ominously...
