_**Garvia:**_

Bamson arrived in a new town called Garvia, the destination of many of his former companions and friends from Hansan Traders. Garvia was a bustling town brimming with adventurers, explorers, and builders, and Bamson felt right at home there. He wasted no time in immersing himself in the town's development efforts.\
\
Bamson was a skilled builder, and he quickly set to work constructing various structures in Garvia. The first structure he built was a fishing hut, which was a cozy spot for players to relax and catch fish. He knew how vital fishing was for many players and wanted to create a welcoming environment for them.\
\
After completing his previous project, Bamson created a gate connecting Garvia with the rest of the server. He built the [Cometfall Crossroads](../cometfall-crossroads.md) gate. This gate facilitated player navigation on the server and offered a safe and secure environment for exploration in the [Finland region](../../).\
\
Bamson also played a significant role in constructing the [Church of Garvia](../church-of-garvia.md), a majestic building that symbolized the town's faith and unity. He worked tirelessly to ensure that every detail of the church was perfect, from the stained glass windows to the mirrored floor interior.\
\
In addition to these structures, Bamson built a market where players could exchange goods and services. He was especially proud of his train station, a brick and sandstone building that connected Garvia with Northstar, a nearby town. He also designed lighthouses along the coast to guide and protect the ships that sailed to and from Garvia.\
\
Bamson made a significant contribution to the development of Garvia. He worked hard to create a friendly, safe, and thriving community for players to enjoy.
