# 🇩🇰 Denmark Region

Denmark boasts of rolling green hills, dense forests, and rugged coastlines, despite its small size. There are several towns established in the region, with [Copenhagen ](copenhagen/)being the first town. Other towns like [Odense ](odense/)and [Esbjerg ](esbjerg.md)were also founded, and the short-lived settlement of [Bedre-Midtsjælland](bedre\_midtsjaelland.md).
