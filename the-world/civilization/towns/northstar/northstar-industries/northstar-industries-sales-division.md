# Northstar Industries - Sales Division

Northstar Industries - Sales Division was founded January 17th, 2024 during the branching act. Northstar Industries had become too big of an entity to drive on its own and therefore was split into two subsidiaries, sales being one of them. The Sales Division handles all marketing, sales and trade connections with partners.
