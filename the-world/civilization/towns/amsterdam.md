Holland was created on August 14, 2024, by [NL\_Kommiedant](../players/nl\_kommiedant.md). The town is situated in the Netherlands area, a part of the map that has been manually added by [NL\_Kommiedant](../players/nl\_kommiedant.md).

When [NL\_Kommiedant](../players/nl\_kommiedant.md) first joined the server, the area that is now the Netherlands did not exist. Due to this, a huge project was started to recreate the parts of the Netherlands that the server map was missing. The initial work plan was drawn up on May 17, 2024, and would serve as a guide on how the new land mass should be formed.

Around August 14, 2024, [NL\_Kommiedant](../players/nl\_kommiedant.md) considered the project done and founded Holland.

The first build steps involved the construction of a larger road to easily move across the work site, this involved a lot off tree burning that luckily and professionally was kept contained and under control.
