\[â€‹Lore]

The Federation of Kesko Corp is a nation made up of exiles, rebels, and adventurers. It was founded by the town of Superalko, which was expelled from Finland by the nation of Kala for unknown reasons. Superalko settled in the Baltic Sea, where it became the capital of the nation. Later, the nation welcomed Raikia, who had been expelled from every nation he joined, and gave him land to build Hiiumaa.

The nation expanded its territory and influence by trading with other nations and colonizing new lands. Helsinki was a town that was established around Superalko, and it became a hub of commerce and culture. However, it declined and was abandoned before Kesko Corp was officially formed. Recently, Fiskerguten has taken the initiative to rebuild the ruined town and restore its glory. Helsinki is now the strongest connection between Kesko Corp and Finland.

Kesko Corp's Reykjavik is a new town situated in Iceland, which has emerged as the only successful colony on the island after several failed attempts by other players. It stands as a testament to the adventurous spirit and resilience of Kesko Corp.

Migning founded the town of Atlantis with the intention of starting the nation of Atlantian Imperium alongside Raikia. However, due to the lack of resources and the presence of mobs, their efforts failed. The Atlantian Imperium was eventually abandoned and forgotten, with many assuming it would join Constellation, another nation. However, Occypolojee purchased the land and added it to Kesko Corp. Today, Atlantis remains a hidden gem within the nation.

The Federation of Kesko Corp is a nation of diversity, creativity, and ambition. It has overcome many challenges and hardships and continues to grow and prosper. It is a nation that values freedom, friendship, and fun.
