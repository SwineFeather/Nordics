# 🛡️ Markers, Emblem & Increasing Borders

This page will provide tips on how to increase borders, regional names, markers, and Coat of Arms. _Coat of Arms can also be known as Town Emblem, heraldry,  logo badge or shield._

1. **Increasing Borders:**
   * Borders can be increased by making changes to the **nature of the land**. This can include building roads, paths, flags, and claiming land by building structures.
   * Players can also use **outposts** at strategic locations to determine and mark their borders. Outposts can be buildings, towers, or other structures that delineate the territory's boundaries.
   * Strengthening borders and cores can be done by proposing documents and clear signals to other nations, indicating a core claim on specific land.
   * Territory can also be acquired through wars, but all players must ensure that the acquisition is confirmed and well-known.
2. **Changing Regional Names:**
   * To change regional names, players can use in-game commands to edit the names of towns, kingdoms, outposts, and plot names.
   * It's also important to communicate the changes with other players to ensure that everyone is aware of the updated regional names.
3. **Creating new Coat of Arms/Town Emblem**
   1.
      * Players can use tools like [azgaar.github.io/Armoria/](https://azgaar.github.io/Armoria/) to create custom Coat of Arms for their nations, towns, or locations.
        * The tool provides various customization options and generation examples for creating unique Coat of Arms.
      * Once a Coat of Arms is designed and finalized, it can be downloaded as a PNG and then uploaded to Dynmap through GitHub or shared through the community.
   2. **How to Upload the new Emblem to Dynmap**
      1. Head to our GitHub assets folder by clicking [**Here**](https://github.com/SwineFeather/Nordics/tree/main/.gitbook/assets)
      2. Click on "Add Files" and then "Upload Files".
      3. Name the Asset (Yourtown.png)
         * <mark style="color:red;">ℹ</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;">If the Asset name is not .png, GitHub won't recognize it as a picture file.</mark>
      4. Wait for our team to accept your change.
4. **Marking Outposts on the Map:**
   * To mark outposts on the map, players will need to give each outpost a name using the in-game command /t outpost name.
   * Once the outposts are named, they will be visible on the map, allowing all players to identify and recognize the various outposts.
