# Town Tax

Each town has a so-called town tax, which is a percentage of how much of one's wealth is paid in tax each day. The town tax ranges between 0 and 10 percent and is determined by the town's mayor. If a player is a member of a town with a town tax of 5 percent and has 1,000 euros in their wallet, they will pay 5 percent of 1,000 in tax to the town, which is 50 euros.

#### No towns&#x20;

If a player is not a member of any town, they do not pay any tax.

#### Sometimes no town tax is paid

&#x20;There are times when no tax is paid.

* If the town a player is a member of has a town tax of 0 percent, they do not pay tax to it.
* If the amount they would pay to the town is less than 1 euro, they do not pay tax.
* &#x20; In some towns, assistants, vice mayors, or mayors do not need to pay town tax. Use `/town info` to see who pays city tax in a town.
