# Vote for the server - get payed

If you want to help Nordics, you are welcome to go to planetminecraft.com/nordics and vote for the server. By doing so, you contribute to making Nordics grow, as the server will rank higher in the server list on planetminecraft

You can vote once a day for the server. For each vote you cast, you will receive 15 euros as a thank you or 25 if you are a Patreon member. You can get approximately 450 euro every month (750 if you are a patron) just by voting for the server!

#### Delayed reward distribution

Sometimes, you may successfully vote for the server but still not receive any rewards. This can happen, for example, if you vote when the server is being restarted. If this occurs, you will receive your reward within a day, at 5:00 AM, provided the server is running.
