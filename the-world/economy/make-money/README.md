# ðŸ’° Make money

### Mobs: :space\_invader:

* Every time you kill a monster, thereâ€™s a chance that youâ€™ll get some money. From â‚¬1 to â‚¬4 per drop.&#x20;
* The economy is based on mob killing, and will in general be the fastest way to make money.

### Wheat: :ear\_of\_rice:

* You can make money from harvesting wheat. `Right-Click` on a crop to quick harvest. To make money you will need to craft **Hay Bales** from wheat. When you have Hay Bales use the command `/sell all` to sell all Hay in your inventory.
* **Craft a Sickle** to easily harvest larger parts of a field. One stick in the middle bottom row, and three ores in an axe formation on the right side.

### Fishing: :fish:

* The server has custom fishing features, each fish is unique with weight and rarity. On average, each fish costs **â‚¬0.35** per kg, and their weight can vary from 0 to 5 kg.&#x20;
* Fishing is no longer as simple as regular Minecraft, you will need to complete a short minigame. Hit the correct block multiple times to win and have a chance to increase its rarity level to win better items.
* Use `/sellfish` or `/sellfish all`  to sell your fish.
* To access a **catalog** of all the fish species you have caught, or enable Vanilla Fishing type in `/fish catalog`. You can also view the leaderboard of the most fish caught and the weight for each fish.
