# Town Tax

Each town has a so-called town tax, which is a percentage of how much of one's wealth is paid in tax each day. The town tax ranges between 0 and 10 percent and is determined by the town's mayor. If a player is a member of a town with a town tax of 5 percent and has €1,000 in their wallet, they will pay 5 percent of €1,000 in tax to the town, which is €50.

#### No towns&#x20;

If a player is not a member of any town, they do not pay any tax.

#### Sometimes no town tax is paid

* If the town a player is a member of has a town tax of 0 percent, they do not pay tax to it.
* If the amount they would pay to the town is less than €1, they do not pay tax.
* In some towns, assistants, vice mayors, or mayors do not need to pay town tax. Use `/town info` to see who pays town tax.
