# Descriptive reasons

One may want to send money to other players, and one should know how the command /pay works for one's benefit. Regardless of how much money one sends or to whom one sends it, one will always need to use the command like this:

`/pay recipient amount reason`&#x20;

The recipient is the player's name who is to receive money from oneself.

**The amount** is how much money will be sent to the recipient, and it should always be a positive integer. The number should only contain numbers, no spaces or anything else.

Most of the time, one finds it quite obvious what the recipient and amount are, but on the other hand, reason can raise some questions.

**The reason** briefly describes why one sends money to the recipient. For example, it may state that the payment is for the purchase of a diamond pickaxe or that it is payment for a job well done. One has a great deal of freedom to determine a reason for oneself, but at the same time, writing a good and appropriate one is very important.

Filling in descriptive reasons is important when sending money to other players and withdrawing money from city treasuries. The reason one fills it in is saved in the city log if it concerns city treasuries and in the wallets of the sender and recipient if it concerns a transfer between players. Sometimes, it may be tempting to write something meaningless like "I don't know" or similar to make it quick to do what one wants. Even though it may take a little longer to write a reason that describes why one is withdrawing or sending money, it is important to do so. If one has not done so and something goes wrong, it can have unexpected consequences.

**Examples of a good reason:** buying five diamonds&#x20;

**Examples of a good reason**: she is my friend, and this money is my birthday present to her

**Examples of a bad reason:** lol haha \
**Examples of a bad reason**: mmmmm what are you doing

The following two examples show what can happen if one does not write the correct reasons.

### Issue with withdrawing money from the town bank&#x20;

**Scenario**: A player is the deputy mayor of a city and has withdrawn 17,000 money from the city treasury. The money was needed to purchase materials for a new road in the city, but the reason for the withdrawal was "need money." The next day, the city's mayor discovers what has happened and reports the deputy mayor for support. A moderator looks at the city log, sees the withdrawal, determines that it violates the city management rules and issues a ban.

**Explanation:** If a city has at least ten members, the money in the city treasury may only be used for things that benefit the city. Even though the deputy mayor in the example withdrew money to purchase materials for a new road, which is probably beneficial to the city, it is very unclear when reading the stated reason. The deputy mayor can appeal the ban in support, but it takes more time and is more problematic than just providing a correct reason.

### Issue with payment to another player

&#x20;**Scenario**: A customer agrees with a seller that the customer will buy 42 diamonds for 1,337 minemynts. The customer pays 1,377 to the seller, and the nation is "giving some money" as the reason. The seller is a scammer who provides neither diamonds nor money but simply disappears from the scene. The customer reports the player to support but does not get their money back there either.

**Explanation**: A moderator can force the seller to refund the money, but to do so, the moderator must first prove that the seller has committed a rule violation. Forcing someone to make a refund is part of resolving a report, and it is up to the moderator to prove that the seller is guilty of fraud – not the other way around. Since the buyer stated "giving some money" as the reason, the seller may perceive it as the buyer simply donating some money rather than as payment for the diamonds. Suppose the buyer has not paid for diamonds (the money sent over was just a donation). In that case, it is also impossible to convict the seller of fraud if he or she does not provide the diamonds, and a moderator cannot force the seller to refund the money.
