* **Towny Compatible**: To create a shop, you must first **set your plot** as a shop plot using **/plot set shop**. You can also create town/nation shops with `/qs town` _(Still WIP, more info soon)_
* **Shops Info on Dynmap**: Hover over the **layers icon** and toggle QuickShop-Hikari Shops to view shop locations on the map.
* **Discounts:** Apply discounts to your chest shops. Use the command:
  * `/quickshop discount create <code> <code-type> <rate> [max-usage] [threshold] [expired-time]`
  * **Code Types:**
  * **PLAYER\_ALL\_SHOPS:** Applied to all shops owned by the code creator.
  * **SPECIFIC\_SHOPS:** Applied to shops in an allow list added with /quickshop discount config \<code> addshop.
  * **Apply Discount as buyer**: /quickshop discount instal&#x6C;_/unistall_ \<code>

**Details**: /quickshop discount info Remove a discount code so players can’t use it: **Remove:** /quickshop discount remove \<code> To determine the best times for discount codes, use this timestamp converter to find the correct Unix time. For a more in-depth guide, visit: [Discount Guide](https://quickshop-community.github.io/QuickShop-Hikari-Documents/docs/addon/discount) **/qs finditem (item)**: View a menu of all items being sold or traded. /finditem still helps locate items in your storage. **/qs list:** View all shops you are selling in. **/qs name**: Name your shop for easier identification on Dynmap and other lists. **List of server shops:** Visit [this link](http://nordics.world:9435/server/Nordics/plugins/QuickShop-Hikari) to **view all shops on the server**. This site also includes server stats and player information. ![🏢](https://ptb.discord.com/assets/fed2f774272b341a8b7c.svg) **Quarters (Apartments for Towny):** Plot owners can now rent out specific areas or floors in a tower.
