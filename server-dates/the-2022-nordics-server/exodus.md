Exodus was founded upon the Principles of the Law's of Chance. Ríos, The God of Chance, is rooted within the culture of the Exoditians with the use of dice to replace decision-making. Society here is based on contingency or, for a better word… luck. Logical decisions are swept aside to claim the price of rolling the dice. As such, there is a whole initiation in coming of age for all Exoditian children. After all, the famous saying goes: “An Exoditian without his dice is no longer an Exoditian”. ‘Mainlanders’, as the Exoditians call them, find stripping a citizen of the Coast of Luck of their dice a true form of mockery. Exoditians have rolled dice over banal simplistic decisions through to murdering their own family. There is only one law here. The law of chance.
