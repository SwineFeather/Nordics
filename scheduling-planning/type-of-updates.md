#### **2. Additional Concepts for Clear Scheduling**

In your Trello, you could have specific categories for each update type:

* **Pending Development**: Content that is actively being worked on, but not ready to be released yet.
* **Finalization/Testing**: Updates that are complete but undergoing final tests or balancing before release.
* **Scheduled Release**: Updates that have a set release date and are fully ready.

This structure helps to separate new content from ongoing maintenance, ensuring a clear workflow from idea to implementation while keeping updates predictable for your players and team.
