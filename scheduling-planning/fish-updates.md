# Fish updates

## **Schedule for Adding New Fishes and Generations**

Considering your existing update schedule, I recommend tying the introduction of new fish and generations into the rhythm of your updates, similar to how games manage competitive seasons. Hereâ€™s a proposed system:

### **New Fish Updates**

* Introduce **new fish** with **every Feature Update** (every 2 months). This ensures constant engagement without overwhelming players with too many new fish at once. You can release 2-3 new fish in these updates, focusing on specific biomes or tiers.

### **Retiring Fish / Starting New Generations**

* Every **6 months**, introduce a **new generation** of fish, similar to competitive season resets. During these events, you can:
  * **Retire** older, less-used fish from previous generations or make them extremely rare in the catch pool.
  * Introduce **new fish** that continue building the evolving ocean ecosystem, making the new generation feel fresh and exciting.
  * Launch a **Generation Event**, with themed rewards or challenges tied to the new generation, giving supporters and players something to look forward to.

### **Annual Cycle**

* Every **year**, you could have a **major fish update** (a new generation milestone), where you introduce a significant number of new fish, overhaul older generations, and release **Gen badges** for all the new fish. This annual event can feel like a major milestone, giving players a reason to engage deeply with the new content.

### Example Schedule:

* **Month 1**: Hotfix + Configuration Update
* **Month 2**: Supporter Update
* **Month 3**: Feature Update (Add new fish, 2-3)
* **Month 4**: Hotfix + Configuration Update
* **Month 5**: Supporter Update
* **Month 6**: Feature Update (Add new fish, 2-3)
* **End of Month 6**: **New Generation Update** (Retire old fish, launch Gen 2, special event)
* **Months 7-12**: Repeat the cycle, with a major milestone **Generation Update** at the end of Month 12.

This system keeps things consistent and exciting, with new fish every two months and a larger event-driven update every six months to keep the ocean fresh!
