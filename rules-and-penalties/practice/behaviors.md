# 2. Behaviors

A page that provides more information about the rules in the behaviour section.

#### 2.1 Fraud

&#x20;Agreements that severely disadvantage one party can also be seen as fraud. In some cases, players try to make agreements with one or more parties so that one player severely exploits the other parties.

When agreeing with another player, it is good to be clear, and both parties must understand what the agreement entails. If an agreement is made with another player, it is also good to have it documented, for example, in the server's chat logs. Agreements that have only been made verbally or on forums other than Nordics or nation groups are difficult to handle.

#### 2.2 Unlawful Killing&#x20;

There are cases where a player automatically accepts that they can be killed.

PvP arenas where there are clear markings about the rules inside the arena. At events where it is marked/explained what applies and when.

#### 2.3 Theft No Steer, Steal, Grief active players:

&#x20;It also counts as theft to take over someone's constructions in nature. This is often referred to as "claiming" others' buildings.

Suppose one intentionally or accidentally picks up an item from the ground owned by someone else. In that case, one must return it if the owner wishes to have it back, even if the player lost the items in connection with a natural death. Refusing to return the items can lead to being convicted of theft.

No player is allowed to interfere with the gameplay of active players in a way that disrupts their experience. This includes but is not limited to intentionally steering/manipulating their actions, stealing their in-game possessions, or causing grief. Any such behaviour will result in disciplinary action.&#x20;

* **War Exception**:
  * In the event of a designated war between players or factions, certain actions that would typically be prohibited may be allowed within the context of the war. This may include:
    * Temporary allowance for stealing resources or items from opposing players or factions as part of the war effort.
    * Permission for limited manipulation of in-game assets, such as altering structures or terrain within the context of the war or conflict. (Admins may revert large changes, ex opposition setting towns, ships on fire)
    * Clear communication and agreement on the rules of engagement and what actions are permissible during the war to ensure that all involved players understand the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.
* **Roleplay Exception**:
  *   In roleplay scenarios, players may be permitted to engage in certain actions that would otherwise be restricted as long as they adhere to the following guidelines:

      * Stealing and manipulating in-game items or assets should be done in the context of roleplay and should not result in permanent loss or significant disruption for other players.
      * Consensual roleplay agreements between participating players or factions clearly outline the boundaries of acceptable behaviour within the roleplay scenario.
      * Any actions taken within the roleplay context should not lead to the permanent destruction or significant alteration of the terrain or major structures in the game world.

      These exceptions allow players to engage in specific activities within the framework of war scenarios or roleplay while maintaining a respectful and enjoyable environment for all participants. It's important to establish clear guidelines and ensure that all involved players understand the boundaries and limitations of these exceptions.
