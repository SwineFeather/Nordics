# Server staff roles



### Personal Roles

For social channels, game servers, and internet forums to function well, a group of dedicated individuals is needed, whose task often involves helping and ensuring that participants, members, players, etc., adhere to specified guidelines and rules. A staff member can also be a person who facilitates a conversation between different parties to have an interesting debate that does not devolve into personal attacks or mudslinging.

There are five levels of staff roles to distinguish staff members who have different areas of responsibility. The higher the rank, the greater the responsibility:

#### Helper - <mark style="color:blue;">**\[H]**</mark>

An Helper supports new players and maintains order in the game's chat channel.

* Duties include warning and banning players who misbehave in the chat channel.
* Their responsibility is limited to the global chat channel, not within towns or nations.
* They should be able to assist players in answering questions about how the server functions.
* Helpers generally do not handle rule violations.&#x20;
* They should also act as moderators to assist in events, conflict resolution, and rule infractions.

Helpers usually do not handle rule violations outside the global chat. Still, they can occasionally intervene in serious rule infractions that harm the server or players if no moderators are present.

Being an Helper is typically an entry-level role for those who have applied to become a moderator on the server. It requires the ability to express oneself to other players in text. One must not be afraid of conflicts, feel responsible for the chat, and be able to assist players with simpler problems easily.

#### **Moderator - **<mark style="color:blue;">**\[M]**</mark>&#x20;

The moderator is Nordics most important function and is the server's universal tool that should be able to handle most tasks. The duties are many, and here are some examples.

* Assist in answering all kinds of questions and refer to where one can find instructions and information about functions and rules on the server.
* Handle conflicts and manage players who misbehave or do not follow rules.
* Manage various types of support cases.
* Demolish and clear blocks that violate the rules.
* Be active and involved in most decisions regarding the server.
* Vote for new moderators.
* Create activities and engage players with small events, competitions, or similar.
* They may have specialist roles responsible for, for example, War, event constructions, PVP arenas, NPC Quests, World Building etc.
* Provide support to mayors who need advanced help with the city.&#x20;
* Write and contribute information to the Wiki and handle support cases.

A moderator is also a regular player who can participate in building cities and coming up with things to do. A moderator can also be a mayor if they find time for it, however, without the help of moderator tools.

There are high demands for patience, insight, knowledge of commands and Minecraft, the ability to express oneself in text, and one must not be conflict-averse.

#### **Administrator - **<mark style="color:blue;">**\[A]**</mark>

Administrators are moderators with greater responsibility and rights to ensure that the world is in good condition, functions and places are operational, and to be able to own certain projects.

* Responsibility for all common events.
* Each administrator normally has a specific area of responsibility to manage and administer.
* Support for mayors who need help with land and/or want to build advanced things or special buildings with functions that help or positively impact the server.
* Support for Management-team in changing parts of the world.
* Voting for new moderators and chat moderators.&#x20;
* High proficiency in building techniques, design, and creativity.
* Generally, have a good understanding of Minecraft blocks and building techniques, including redstone and logical functions.
* Writing and contributing information to the Wiki.
* Have the right to use and assign temporary permissions to players as needed to solve certain tasks.

Administrators can be regular players. However_, alternative accounts are suggested_. They can have cities and engage in trade, but not with the help of rights that come with their rank. All gaming MUST be conducted under the same conditions as regular players. They can help regular players with various construction or demolition, but only in survival mode.

#### **Management - **<mark style="color:red;">**\[A]**</mark>

The manager is a form of administrator (abbreviated admin with a purple A instead of turquoise) who is part of the management group. The manager is responsible for the entire server.

* Responsible for the total function and administration of the server.
* Responsibility for all moderators and all ranks.
* Responsible for recruitment and decision-making regarding ranks and permissions.&#x20;
* Establishes rules and directives for players and moderators.
* Manages more complex problems and conflicts, including conflicts involving moderators.
* Together with the administrators, it drives the state's development of buildings and state functions.
* Together with the developers, drives the development of features and additions ("plugins")
* Responsible for all information in the library.
* The manager can make exceptions to current rules and practices when necessary.

A head administrator/chief administrator is ultimately responsible for the server's operations and functions. The head administrator has the final say in all major decisions or decisions tied to votes. The head administrator is chosen by the server owner and the management team. Therefore, it does not have to be the server owner who is ultimately responsible.

There are high demands for responsibility, judgment, adaptability, understanding of others, a sense of order, conflict management ability, making uncomfortable decisions, and seeing things from a broader perspective. The manager often mentors administrators, moderators, and chat moderators and should be a support function when needed.



### **With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility**&#x20;

Personnel members have greater responsibility and higher expectations for their behaviour and conduct. The punishment for a staff member who knowingly and severely abuses their rights can be much harsher than for a player. If a staff member is found to be abusing their rights and/or trust, the responsible administrator judges the case and determines any penalties. Those on the staff have been entrusted to be staff members and mustn't abuse that trust.

#### **Voluntary Work**

It is important to understand that all of the staff are regular people. They are often young individuals with different strengths and weaknesses but share a common interest. And they are all here voluntarily. The work on the server takes place in the same free time as you play, and there is no form of financial or material compensation. The "compensation" instead comes in the form of experiences and lessons in many areas: Minecraft, people, organization, ethics and morals, leadership, problem-solving, coding, software learning, and what it means sometimes to be vulnerable. These are lessons that can be useful in real life.

Since this is voluntary, placing excessive demands on the time a staff member must dedicate to the server is difficult. Different staff members are skilled or experienced in different areas. Some staff members have less time, while others have more. Therefore, it is necessary to respect that fewer staff members are logged in at certain times or periods, and sometimes there may be more. Ensuring that there are often enough staff members logged in is something that the management continuously works on.

#### **To make mistakes**&#x20;

Staff members also have permission to make mistakes to a certain extent. One learns through mistakes, and it is when things develop. If someone makes a mistake, no one will be scolded or banned. There may be exceptions depending on how serious it is, but in most cases, we ensure that the mistake becomes a lesson and then move on. The important thing is not to repeat it. Some players have difficulty seeing it from this perspective, expecting the moderator to be more or less flawless. Just like all people, one must stumble a few times before walking. And even those who can walk sometimes stumble.

### **Recruitment**&#x20;

One can become a part of the Nordics staff by applying when there is an open application form or by contacting anyone in the moderation team.

A staff member should be driven to create a good gaming environment that works for as many people as possible and creates order and structure. A staff member must also enjoy personal growth, even in areas that they find challenging. One is often new and inexperienced at the beginning, but over time can grow and learn many things, and it is during this journey that one also grows and gains experience.

Staff members are also very vulnerable and easily accused of making mistakes or wrong decisions. This must be managed, and one must understand that meeting all players' needs or desires is impossible. Therefore, the selection process for staff is quite difficult.

**One cannot nag their way to a rank on Nordics.** If one does, they have not understood why we have selections and how an organization is built by selecting the best-suited individuals.
