_Migning founded the town of Atlantis intending to start the nation of Atlantian Imperium alongside Raikia. However, their efforts failed due to the lack of resources and the presence of mobs. The Atlantian Imperium was eventually abandoned and forgotten, with many assuming it would join Constellation, another nation. However, Occypolojee purchased the land and added it to Kesko Corp. Today, Atlantis remains a hidden gem within the nation._\
