# Server-Wide War Event

## **Server-Wide War Event: Emerald Guardians vs Amethyst Enchanters**

Get ready for an epic, once-a-year event that will transform the entire server into a massive battleground! The **War Event** is a three-day spectacle where all players can join a clash of nations, taking on different roles, battling for victory, and creating a new chapter in the server's history. No need to worry about losing your personal items or resources—everyone will participate using special event classes and equipment.

## Event Overview

The **War Event** will be a one-time special occurrence held on the **Ireland Isle**. Players will fight as members of one of two nations: the **Emerald Guardians** (Green Team) and the **Amethyst Enchanters** (Purple Team). This event is designed to bring together everyone on the server in a thrilling, strategic battle that will last from **Friday to Sunday**.

To participate, players must pick from a range of classes provided by the **TownyCombat** plugin: **Light Infantry, Light Cavalry, Medium Cavalry, Heavy Cavalry, Medium Infantry, and Heavy Infantry**. This variety of roles adds strategic depth to the battles, allowing players to use different combat styles and tactics.

Before the event begins, the server will be **turned off for an hour** for maintenance and preparation. Once the server reopens, players will have **45 minutes** to log in, secure their items, and prepare. We encourage players to store their items in **end chests** or their bases. However, for convenience, a **Skript** will automatically save all player inventories to our database. To ensure no items are lost, players are encouraged to follow these guidelines, as a safety measure against bugs.

### Choosing Your Nation

Once players have cleared their inventories, a **team selection UI** will open with a **5-second countdown**. Players will have the chance to pick between the **Green Team (Emerald Guardians)** and the **Purple Team (Amethyst Enchanters)**. To maintain fairness, a **weight system** is in place: players cannot join the team with more members until both teams are balanced. Players who do not select a team will be automatically assigned to even out the sides. Once you select a team and press **Confirm**, your choice will be locked in.

After selecting teams, players will be **teleported to the battlefield**. One nation will be stationed in **Northern Ireland** (Greenhearth), and the other in **Southern Ireland** (Mysthaven). A **border will be set up** around the Ireland Isle to keep everyone within the battle area during the three-day event.

### War Mechanics

All **wartypes are enabled** in this event, meaning anything can happen—it will be a **Nation vs. Nation** war by default, but players can even **riot** to split from their nation and form their own towns if they wish. This dynamic system keeps the battles unpredictable and allows for shifting alliances.

The war economy will be powered by **funds from inactive accounts and banned players**. Players won't lose any of their own hard-earned currency. Each nation will begin with **500 euros** to fund town upkeep and expansion, and there will be a **base spoils of 1000 euros** at the start of the war. Participants will also earn **10 euros** for each enemy killed and **5 euros** for each town plot seized. These funds will be transferred directly to the nation's balance, with the goal of supporting expansion and strength.

At the end of the event, the money accumulated by each nation will be **distributed evenly** to its players, ensuring that no wealth is lost in the war. When the war ends, the **nations and towns** created for the event will vanish, but **all structures and buildings** will remain, preserving the legacy of the battles. An **artifact book** will be spawned at both nation capitals, telling the story of the war, and will remain unbreakable as a permanent server relic.

### Battle Sessions and Event Timeline

The event will begin on **Friday at 18:00**, with **preparations starting an hour before**. The event will end on **Sunday at 20:00**, with an hour afterward for players to discuss the event, receive prizes, and for admins to ensure everything returns to normal.

Throughout the event, there will be specific **battle sessions** during which players can engage in PvP combat. These sessions are one hour each, and PvP is only allowed during these times:

### Prizes and Special Roles

This event is for everyone—not just PvPers! Players can also compete for prizes by excelling in **building** or **farming**. There will be two awards for the **best Builder** and **best Farmer**, encouraging players who may not be combat-focused to participate and contribute to their team's success.

A **Voice Chat Mod** will also be enabled for the event. Players are encouraged to install the mod so they can communicate directly with their teammates during the battles, adding to the excitement and coordination.

### Preparation and Guidelines

* **Server Preparation**: One hour of server downtime for maintenance before the event begins.
* **Preparation Phase**: Players will have **45 minutes** to log in, store their items, and prepare for war. Guides and tips will be shared in **Discord voice chat** to help players understand the event.
