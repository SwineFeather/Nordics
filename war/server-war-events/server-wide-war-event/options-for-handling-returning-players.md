# Options for Handling Returning Players:

#### Options for Handling Returning Players:

1. **Automatic Team Assignment Based on Balance**:
   * **Team Assignment**: If an OG player joins late, they can be automatically assigned to the **team with fewer members** to maintain balance. This prevents one team from gaining an unfair advantage due to additional players.
   * **Catch-Up Tutorial**: Provide a **quick recap** of the rules and their current role, either via an automated message or by referring them to the **Discord voice chat** for a briefing. This ensures they understand what has transpired and their responsibilities.
2. **Pre-Selected Team Integration**:
   * If the player already **chose a team** before the event started, they can be **reintegrated** into that team without reassignment, regardless of balance. To keep things fair, you could still assign them roles or gear to match the **current game stage**—not allowing them to bring in extra advantages.
   * If they haven't picked a team yet, they should follow the **balanced team assignment system** as described for new players.
3. **Class and Role Selection Adjustment**:
   * Players joining late should still be given the option to **choose a role**. However, based on what is needed by the team at the time, certain classes might be **restricted** if they are already well-filled. This way, late-joining players contribute to filling gaps, such as joining a less-populated class like **Light Infantry** if needed.
   * Provide them with a **catch-up gear set** equivalent to what others have earned so far during the event, so they are not at a disadvantage compared to those who started earlier.
4. **Limited Late Entry Integration**:
   * To prevent players from joining during key battle sessions without preparation, **OG players can only join between battle sessions**. This way, they have some time to integrate into their team, get oriented, and prepare themselves.
   * This also helps maintain fairness, as players joining during combat can create an imbalance or be overwhelmed.
5. **Role of Non-Combatant or Support** (If Fairness is a Concern):
   * If the server feels the late entry might disrupt battle dynamics, OG players could be given **support roles** initially. They can participate as **builders, farmers, or strategists** until the next battle session, after which they can take on a combat role.
   * This allows them to contribute meaningfully to the war effort without immediately impacting the frontline dynamics.
6. **Pre-War Debriefing**:
   * Make sure that **OG players** who join late are **briefed** on what's happened so far in the war, either via an automated message, wiki page, or **Discord** discussion. This way, they aren’t lost and can understand the strategy and context before jumping in.

#### Example Workflow for Late-Joining OG Players:

* **Step 1**: Upon logging in, the player is prompted to **confirm their participation** in the ongoing War Event.
* **Step 2**: If they haven't selected a team, they are **automatically assigned** based on balance.
* **Step 3**: A **briefing** message is sent, updating them on the current status of the war and providing quick links to the **wiki** or **Discord voice chat**.
* **Step 4**: They are given an opportunity to **select a role** (from available options).
* **Step 5**: If they join **between battle sessions**, they are **teleported to their team’s territory** and can start contributing immediately.

#### Integration Guidelines:

1. **Balance Maintenance**: To maintain **fair team balance**, OG players should ideally be assigned to the team with fewer members unless they pre-selected a team.
2. **Role Flexibility**: Offer them roles that align with their team's current needs. This might mean filling in gaps in certain classes or taking on **support roles** if balance is critical.
3. **Late-Entry Gear**: Provide appropriate gear and equipment that reflects the progress of the event up to that point, ensuring that late joiners are not significantly weaker or stronger.
