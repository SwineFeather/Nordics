# Event Rules

## Event Rules

1. **No Griefing Your Own Team**:
   * Players are strictly forbidden from intentionally sabotaging their own team by griefing or feeding points to the enemy. Such behavior will not be tolerated.
2. **Rebellion Option**:
   * If you are unhappy with your team, you may **riot and create your own town**. However, it is not possible to use `/t leave` to leave your nation; you must rebel against it to make a change.
3. **Forming Bases**:
   * You are allowed to **go outside your town** and set up your own small base, but bases **cannot be built underground or high in the air**. Bases must be on natural terrain, but you are allowed to hide them to some extent.
4. **Server Rules Apply**:
   * All **standard server rules** remain in effect during the event, including no hacking, exploiting, or other prohibited actions.
5. **Follow Role and Class Guidelines**:
   * Players must stick to the **roles and classes** they choose at the beginning of the event. Using unauthorized items or switching classes outside the permitted system is not allowed.
6. **No Team Switching After Confirmation**:
   * Once you confirm your team selection, you are **locked into that team**. Switching teams afterward is not allowed.
7. **Battle Session Restrictions**:
   * **PvP is only allowed during designated battle sessions**. Attacking or griefing players outside of these sessions is strictly prohibited.
8. **Respect the Event Flow**:
   * During the **preparation phase**, all players must **store their items** properly and prepare for the event. Failure to comply with these instructions may lead to inventory losses.
9. **Voice Chat Etiquette**:
   * With the **Voice Chat Mod** enabled, use it respectfully—no harassment, spamming, or abusive language will be tolerated.
10. **No Building Bases Underground or High Up in the Air**:
    * Bases must be built on natural terrain and **cannot be underground or excessively high in the air**. Players are allowed to **hide their bases** to some extent, but they must still follow this rule to maintain fairness.
11. **Setting Up Traps**:
    * Players are allowed to **set up traps** for enemies, but these traps must not be designed to **harm teammates**. Traps should contribute to team defense, not disrupt team cohesion.

### Additional Rules to Consider

1. **No Unauthorized Teleporting**:
   * During the event, unauthorized teleportation commands (e.g., `/tp`) are disabled to maintain fairness. Only admins may teleport for administrative purposes.
2. **Team Cooperation Required**:
   * All players must **actively contribute to their team**. Intentional idling or refusing to participate in either PvP, building, or farming activities to sabotage your team may result in removal from the event.
3. **No Combat Logging**:
   * **Combat logging** (logging out during a fight to avoid death) is prohibited. Players caught doing this may receive penalties such as point deductions for their team.
4. **No Block Glitching or Exploits**:
   * Players are not allowed to use **block glitching** or other exploits to bypass the event's intended mechanics. This includes glitching through barriers or circumventing borders.
5. **Resource Gathering Limitations**:
   * Players may **gather resources** during the event, but exploiting resources for personal gain outside of your team's goals is not allowed. Resources gathered should contribute towards team efforts like fortifying defenses or building structures.
6. **Respect Admin Decisions**:
   * Admins and moderators are present to enforce rules and ensure fair gameplay. **Respect admin decisions**, and avoid arguing during the event. If there are concerns, they can be discussed after the event in a formal manner.
7. **No Spawn Camping**:
   * Players are not allowed to **camp enemy spawn points** to repeatedly kill respawning players. This ensures all players have a fair chance to re-enter the battle.
8. **Artifact Protection**:
   * **Artifact books** that spawn at the end of the event must not be tampered with. They are intended to preserve the legacy of the war and are unbreakable by design.

These rules are intended to maintain the integrity and fairness of the event while promoting a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone. Let me know if there’s anything more you'd like to add or adjust!
