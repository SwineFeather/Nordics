# How to win the War

Ending the event can be a defining moment, and making it dynamic can add to the excitement and satisfaction of players. Here are a few different approaches you could take for ending the **War Event**:

#### 1. **Time-Based Ending (End on Sunday)**

* **Fixed End Time**: The event ends at **20:00 on Sunday** as originally planned, regardless of the situation on the battlefield.
* **Evaluation of Points**: At the end of the event, the **team with the most points** (based on kills, town plots taken, and other metrics) is declared the winner. This type of ending keeps the timeline predictable, which players appreciate for planning purposes.
* **Advantages**:
  * Players know exactly when the event will end and can prepare accordingly.
  * Keeps the event accessible to players who may only be able to participate at certain times.
* **Disadvantages**:
  * A team that is dominating might be less motivated if they have to simply wait for the time to run out, reducing momentum.

#### 2. **Victory Point System (Dynamic Ending)**

* **Victory by Points**: Set a **target score** that a team must reach to **win the war**. For example, if a team reaches **5000 points** (points accumulated through kills, sieges, and completing objectives), they win immediately.
* **Score Sources**:
  * **Killing Enemies**: Each kill adds **10 points** to the team.
  * **Conquering Town Plots**: Successfully capturing a town plot adds **50 points**.
  * **Special Objectives**: Hidden objectives or missions, such as capturing a strategic point, could reward **100-200 points**.
* **Advantages**:
  * Adds **urgency** and competitiveness to the event, as teams strive to reach the target score.
  * Allows the possibility of the event ending early if one team proves dominant, making the conclusion more dramatic.
* **Disadvantages**:
  * The event could end earlier than expected, which might be disappointing to some players looking forward to more playtime.

#### 3. **Elimination-Based Ending (Survival Mode)**

* **Team Elimination**: The event ends when all towns of one team are completely **conquered** or **destroyed**, or when a nation is reduced to fewer than a certain number of active players. This method is about **attrition**, and the last team standing wins.
* **Conditions for Elimination**:
  * A team can be eliminated if **all their towns are conquered**.
  * The event also ends if the **capital** of one team falls and all remaining towns are unable to defend themselves.
* **Advantages**:
  * A clear-cut ending that feels very conclusive.
  * Creates a sense of **survival**, encouraging players to defend as a last resort.
* **Disadvantages**:
  * Risk of **discouraging players** if they lose early. Eliminated players might feel they have nothing left to do until the end of the event.

#### 4. **Combination Ending (Hybrid Approach)**

* **Set a Deadline with a Victory Condition**:
  * The event has a fixed **end time** on Sunday, but the event **can also end earlier** if one team reaches a certain **victory condition**.
  * Victory conditions could include reaching a **target score**, eliminating the enemy team by capturing their **capital**, or conquering a certain percentage of their **land**.
* **Advantages**:
  * Combines the excitement of a **dynamic victory** with the predictability of a fixed end time.
  * Players can work toward either eliminating the opposing team or accumulating as many points as possible by the final deadline.
* **Disadvantages**:
  * Complexity might make it harder for some players to follow if there are multiple win conditions.

#### 5. **Peace Negotiation Option**

* Introduce the possibility of a **negotiated peace** if both teams are **equally matched** or exhausted by the end of the event.
* **Negotiation Mechanics**:
  * A **leader from each team** negotiates peace terms, with admin oversight.
  * Players could decide to **split the spoils** and share the titles or declare a **truce** that is celebrated at the end.
* **Advantages**:
  * Gives players the **agency** to end the war on their own terms, which could be exciting for those interested in diplomacy.
* **Disadvantages**:
  * It might feel less climactic for those hoping for a final, clear-cut victory.

#### Suggested Approach

A **Combination Ending (Hybrid Approach)** seems most suitable for maximizing excitement while maintaining structure:

* **Fixed End Time** on **Sunday at 20:00** to maintain predictability and ensure everyone knows when the event will end.
* **Dynamic Win Condition**: If a team reaches **5000 points** before the set end time, they win early. This ensures that if one team is clearly dominant, they can achieve victory sooner, adding urgency.
* **Victory by Capital**: If one team successfully captures the other team's **capital**, that team immediately wins, adding a clear and dramatic way to end the event.

#### Implementation Example

* **Sunday 20:00**: If no team has won by score or captured the capital, the **team with the most points** wins.
* **Reaching 5000 Points**: A team wins instantly if they accumulate **5000 points** at any time during the event.
* **Capital Conquest**: If a team's capital falls, the event ends with the opposing team as the victor.

This **hybrid approach** ensures the event has an exciting finish that can happen naturally based on player performance, while also providing a clear end time to accommodate players who want to plan ahead. Let me know which approach resonates with you, or if you'd like to tweak any of these ideas!
