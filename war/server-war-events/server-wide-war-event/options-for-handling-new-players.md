# Options for Handling New Players:

If a **new player** joins the server while the **War Event** is ongoing, it's important to ensure that their experience is welcoming and clear, without disrupting the event. Here are some options for handling new players during the event:

#### Options for Handling New Players:

1. **Spectator Mode (Recommended)**:
   * **Join as Spectators**: New players could be automatically placed in **Spectator Mode**. This allows them to **watch the ongoing war** without actively participating. It gives them a feel for the community and the event, while ensuring they do not disrupt the eventâ€™s balance.
   * **Guided Tour**: Provide a brief guide or information about what is happening and how they can join future events. They could receive a message explaining the event and a link to your **wiki** or **Discord** for more information.
2. **Delayed Participation**:
   * **Restricted Access**: If joining the war mid-event is possible, new players could be **restricted** from joining a team until the next **battle session**. This would prevent immediate unbalanced contributions and allow them to prepare properly.
   * **Preparation Phase**: Give new players time to learn about the mechanics and roles before they are allowed to join the fight. Assign them a **neutral zone** to explore until they can be integrated properly.
3. **Automatic Team Assignment**:
   * **Auto-Assign to Teams**: New players could be automatically assigned to the **team with fewer members** to help balance the teams. They should receive basic gear and a tutorial to get them up to speed quickly.
   * **Role Selection UI**: Provide new players with the **role selection UI** after they join a team. This ensures they are assigned a suitable role, similar to existing players, and get a fair introduction to their responsibilities.
4. **Event Exclusion with Tutorial**:
   * **Event-Exclusive Area**: Restrict new players from participating in the event and have them join a **tutorial area** that introduces them to basic mechanics, server rules, and features.
   * **Join Next Time**: Inform them that the **War Event** is currently ongoing and that they will be able to fully participate in future events. This keeps the experience fair for existing participants while ensuring new players aren't overwhelmed or confused.
5. **Temporary Peaceful Integration**:
   * **Non-Combatant Role**: Allow new players to join a team but assign them as **non-combatants** initially. They could help with **farming**, **gathering resources**, or **building defenses** for their team, making them useful without giving them a combat role until they are ready.
