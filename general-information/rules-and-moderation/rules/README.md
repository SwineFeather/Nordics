## 1. **Cheating and Technical Issues**&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**1.1**</mark>** Use of Cheats:** Those who use any form of cheats, mods, or programs that provide unfair advantages in the game will be convicted of cheating.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**1.3**</mark>** Exploitation of technical issues or bugs:** Players who discover a bug or unintended feature must report it immediately to the server admins or moderators and must not use it for personal gain. Exploiting such issues, whether known or unknown to the public or the server staff, will result in severe penalties.

<mark style="color:blue;">**1.4**</mark>** Multi-Accounting:** Those who **exploit** multiple accounts to generate in-game currency on the server will be convicted of multi-accounting.

<mark style="color:green;">**3.1**</mark>** Inappropriate language use:**  Those who choose careless, inappropriate, unsuitable, or foreign words are judged for inappropriate language use. This includes, but is not limited to, chat, private messages, player names, naming of items, plots and towns, the website, and Discord. By foreign language use, it refers to text written in languages other than Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and English, or languages in a dialect that differs significantly from the common language.

<mark style="color:red;">**3.2**</mark>** Provocation:** Those who intentionally express xenophobia, hatred, threats, sexual innuendos, or revenge are judged for provocation. This includes, but is not limited to, expressions in writing and constructions.

<mark style="color:green;">**3.3**</mark>** Spam:** Anyone who repeats many similar messages in a short time or sends junk messages in any of Nordic's communication channels is judged for spam.

## 4. Buildings and Grieifing

&#x20;<mark style="color:yellow;">**4.1**</mark>** Vandalism:** Vandalism, including the placement of annoying blocks, large-scale grieifing, and destructive use of fluids like lava and water, is generally prohibited. Destruction of unclaimed areas is allowed, but claimed towns and structures are protected from significant damage. However, during a formally declared war, some grieifing is permitted under specific conditions, focusing on strategic objectives rather than total destruction. Post-war rebuilding and reparations are encouraged to maintain server harmony.

<mark style="color:blue;">**4.2**</mark>** Unauthorized construction:** Intentionally constructs a trap, an arena, or other structure to harm or kill players in a **public** town Those who construct something that meets the criteria for "3.1 inappropriate language use" or "3.2 provocation" are judged for either unauthorized construction, inappropriate language use, or provocation.

<mark style="color:blue;">**4.3**</mark>** Unauthorized aircraft:** Anyone who builds or uses aircraft that do not meet the requirements for building aircraft is judged for building or using unauthorized aircraft.

### 4.5. Griefing  &#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">4.5.1</mark>. Large-scale griefing within a town claim, or in the wilderness within 3 chunks of a claim, is disallowed unless done by the claim owner.   \
&#x20;  <mark style="color:blue;">4.5.1.1.</mark> This includes the removal of buildings, unless there is explicit permission from the town owner to proceed, or if the player removing the structure is also the one who built it.  &#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">4.5.2</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">.</mark> If staff determines that the amount of griefing is exceptionally extensive, it will be classified as Major Griefing and penalized more severely than standard griefing.

<mark style="color:blue;">4.5.3</mark>. Griefing overworld roads, including ice roads, rails, and superficial structures, is subject to player-driven resolution. If a player damages a road and is inactive or unwilling to resolve the issue, the road will be restored, and the player may face penalties. However, if the player actively participates in a role-play scenario to repair or make amends, then it is allowed. This rule aligns with Combat Logging policies. Road owners noticing grief can request that admins identify the player responsible.

<mark style="color:blue;">4.5.4</mark>. Removing any amount of redstone blocks from an upgraded road is prohibited and will be subject to similar role-play resolution or restoration if not addressed by the player.

<mark style="color:blue;">4.5.5</mark>. Extreme resource collection may be considered griefing, subject to admin discretion. However, if large-scale resource removal is involved, players can collaborate with admins to incorporate role-play or lore, potentially leading to changes in the world, such as the addition of a new continent or island.

### 4.6 Redstone rules:&#x20;

<mark style="color:blue;">**4.6.1**</mark>** Avoid Excessive Redstone Clocks:** Continuous redstone clocks or circuits that run indefinitely can cause significant lag. Players should design circuits that deactivate when not in use or utilize observer-based or delay-based timers to minimize server load.

<mark style="color:blue;">**4.6.2**</mark>** Use Chunk-Aligned Builds:** Each town allows only one large-scale farm (except for bamboo and kelp farms), limited to 5 by 5 chunks on a single layer. Redstone components must stay within 20% of the total farm area and operate solely on player-initiated power. Prohibited are redstone clocks, daylight sensors, and continuous triggers; instead, a button press initiates one cycle of operation.

<mark style="color:blue;">**4.6.3**</mark>** Avoid Automatic Farms That Run Continuously:** Automatic farms that run continuously, especially those that generate large amounts of entities (e.g., mob farms, crop farms), should be limited or designed with on/off switches to reduce lag.

<mark style="color:red;">**4.6.4**</mark>** No Exploitative Redstone:**Any use of redstone intended to exploit game mechanics, duplicate items, or otherwise gain an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited. This includes machines designed to overload the server or bypass intended game limitations.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**4.6.5**</mark>** Responsibility for Redstone Lag:** Players are responsible for ensuring their redstone builds do not negatively impact server performance. If a redstone creation is found to cause significant lag, players may be asked to modify or remove it.

## 5. Staff-related rules

**5.1. Compensation in Case of Death:** Players are generally responsible for the risks they take in the game. Compensation is only considered for non-natural deaths caused by technical issues, such as server lag or glitches. Natural deaths, like monster attacks or falls, are not eligible for compensation. Moderators will assess each case individually.

5.2.1. Items purchased accidentally with a value below 1k are not eligible for reimbursement.

&#x20;   5.2.2. Staff will not reimburse any item more than once.

### 5.3. Staff Conduct Rules

<mark style="color:yellow;">5.3.1</mark>. Staff must not use their in-game permissions for non-staff-related activities that impact other players.\
<mark style="color:blue;">5.3.2</mark>. Staff must not use their permissions on Discord or Minecraft to block or restrict communication for other community members without a valid reason.\
<mark style="color:purple;">**5.3.3**</mark>. Staff must not misuse personal information obtained through official staff channels to gain leverage, an unfair advantage, or for blackmail.

<mark style="color:blue;">5.3.4</mark>. Applying a punishment that disregards the Statute of Limitations or internal staff guidelines is considered staff abuse.\
<mark style="color:yellow;">5.3.5</mark>. Using staff permissions to take action without sufficient evidence or for personal gain is considered staff abuse.\
<mark style="color:blue;">**5.3.6**</mark>. Administrators are restricted from participating in geopolitics, specifically:\
&#x20; 5.3.6.1. They may not lead nations or countries represented on the world map.\
&#x20; 5.3.6.2. They may not engage in diplomacy, such as signing documents, negotiating, or paying for assistance in wars.\
&#x20; 5.3.6.3. They may not participate in war leadership. Admins involved in the war department or handling war tickets are not allowed to participate in wars at all.\
&#x20; 5.3.6.4. Staff members involved in the war department may not act as players in war tickets.\
&#x20; 5.3.6.5. Senior war staff members, and war staff members at the Sr. Mod level or higher, are prohibited from leading nations or engaging in geopolitics, except in cases of defending a claim they own. This rule applies to all new war staff but excludes current war staff.
