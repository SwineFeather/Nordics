# 3. Communication

A page that provides more information about the rules in the section for communication channels.

#### 3.1 Inappropriate language

&#x20;Inappropriate language includes inappropriate topics of conversation. Topics that may be inappropriate on Nordics include, for example, politics, religion, tobacco, drugs, and topics of a sexual nature. Those moderating the chat at the time determine where the line is drawn. Something that may be okay at one time is not automatically okay at another time, and vice versa. Ask a moderator or chat guard for advice if you are unsure whether what you want to write is okay. If no one is to ask and you are unsure, the recommendation is not to bring it up.

It is completely okay to talk about things unrelated to Nordics. But if it's a private conversation with a friend, it's best to keep it private, for example, in /msg on the server. If it's a private conversation among many parties, there is a function to activate a meeting on the server or go to a separate room on Discord.

You can be punished if your writing leads others to interpret it as inappropriate.

#### 3.5 Unlawful opposition

&#x20;Constructive criticism: "Constructive criticism usually refers to criticism intended to improve the criticized, for example, by providing suggestions for change."

Critiquing, commenting, and questioning the server, moderators, and more is completely okay. It is through criticism that we develop, and we must receive this. But criticism must also be done correctly otherwise, the criticism will not be constructive.
