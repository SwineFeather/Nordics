# 1. Cheating and Technical Issues

&#x20;A page that provides more information about the rules in the cheating and technical issues section.

#### 1.1 Use of Cheating&#x20;

The rules state that anyone who uses any form of cheating, add-ons, or programs that provide unfair advantages in the game will be judged for cheating. There are exceptions to this rule, and below is a list of modifications allowed to be used on the server.

List of allowed modifications and their guidelines:

* **Client mods:** Players are prohibited from using client mods known to cause server crashes or instability. Any client mods that have the potential to disrupt the server/player performance or cause crashes are strictly forbidden. Any concerns about specific mods should be brought to the attention of the server administrators for evaluation and approval before use.
* Freecam mods are only allowed in matters of building; in terms of war, events and conflicts are not allowed. Also allowed in terms of media and videos

Performance-enhancing

* Optifine (including Shaders), BetterFPS Mod
* Fabulously Optimized (excluding the use of analog controllers that this enables)

Armor and effect status

* Armor Status, Effect Status, HudPixel

Maps

* Minimaps are allowed if they meet these requirements:
  * The map does not show other entities or players.
  * The map does not show underground caves.

Aids

* Schematica and Litematica (or equivalent)
  * It is allowed to use Schematica or Litematica, but only for building.
* Replay Mod
  * Must not be abused to reveal hidden locations.

Brightness and gamma

* It is okay to adjust the brightness or gamma in your Minecraft client.

Aesthetic mods

* Shaders mod, Betterfoliage, Sound filters, Mo'bends

Other mods

* CraftPresence

If you have a modification you want to use that is not on the list, ask first if it is okay to use. If we approve the modification, it will be added to the list.

#### **1.3 Technical Issues**&#x20;

**Examples of Unacceptable Exploits:**

1. **Unauthorized Commands:**
   * **Example:** A `/heads` command was intended to be accessible only by certain ranks, but was discovered to be available to all players. Default players who exploited this command to gain decorative heads without permission are in violation of this rule.
2. **World Border Exploitation:**
   * **Example:** Due to a configuration error, the world border was set to generate terrain instead of void. Players who discovered and exploited this mistake by expanding into unintended terrain or accessing resources not meant to be available broke this rule.
3. **Unintended Block and Water Placement:**
   * **Example:** Players who exploit bugs allowing them to place blocks or water in areas where it should not be possible (e.g., mid-air block placements, standing in non-existent water) are not allowed to use these bugs for an advantage, even if they are known.
4. **Nether Ceiling Access:**
   * **Clarification:** While accessing the Nether ceiling (above Y-level 128) is not forbidden, it is treated as void, and players who survive or exploit this area by any means that bypass instant death will be penalized.

**Bugs That Are Tolerated:**

Some bugs are tolerated due to their minor impact or the difficulty in enforcing their prohibition:

* **Block Placement Bugs:** Minor bugs allowing block placement in specific scenarios, such as placing blocks in the air or temporary block jumps, are tolerated because they do not significantly affect gameplay or server performance.
* **Water Bucket Bugs:** Similarly, placing water in unintended places, such as creating temporary water sources in odd locations, is allowed if it does not give an unfair advantage.

**Reporting and Compliance:**

1. **Mandatory Reporting:** Any player who discovers a bug or unintended feature must report it to the server staff immediately. Failing to report such issues or continuing to use them will be considered an exploitation.
2. **No Usage of Unreported Bugs:** If a bug or unintended feature is not publicly documented or known to the server staff, players must assume that its usage is prohibited until clarified otherwise. Exploiting any such unknown bug will lead to strict penalties.
3. **Consequences of Exploitation:**
   * **First Offense:** Players caught exploiting bugs or technical issues will face severe penalties, including item confiscation, temporary bans, or rank demotion, depending on the severity of the exploitation.
   * **Repeat Offenses:** Repeated violations will result in permanent bans and possible rollback of affected areas.
4. **Accountability:** This rule extends to the use of multiple accounts or accessing another player's account to exploit bugs or bypass penalties. Such actions will be treated as serious offenses and dealt with accordingly.

1.4 **Multi-accounting**
