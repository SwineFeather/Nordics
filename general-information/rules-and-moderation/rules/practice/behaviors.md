#### 2.1 Deception

&#x20;Agreements that severely disadvantage one party can also be seen as fraud. In some cases, players try to make agreements with one or more parties so that one player severely exploits the other parties.

When agreeing with another player, it is good to be clear, and both parties must understand what the agreement entails. If an agreement is made with another player, it is also good to have it documented, for example, in the server's chat logs. Agreements that have only been made verbally or on forums other than Nordics or nation groups are difficult to handle.
