* :shield: **Fair Play**: Utilizing 'clever use of game mechanics' or manipulating in-game mechanics to gain an unfair advantage is prohibited. This includes bugs or features that are not documented, or known to the public.
* :no\_entry: **Monster Farms & AFK Fishing**: The use of monster farms and AFK fishing is completely prohibited, anywhere, on the server.
* :x:**No Cheating, Hacking or Duping**: Engaging in any form of cheating, hacking, duping, or exploiting vulnerabilities for an advantage will result in immediate action being taken.
* :handshake:**Respectful Conduct and Transparency**: Any form of derogatory or bigoted language is prohibited, as well as racism and homophobia. Additionally, players are not allowed to hide or change their in-game names in a manner that obscures their identity to others.
* :earth\_americas:**World Borders**: One is not allowed to be outside the world borders or enter the void. Traveling in Generational Terrain is strictly prohibited. Building outside of, over, or underworld borders is not permitted. This rule also extends to the Nether, where players should not attempt to breach or build above or below the bedrock layers. You cannot go outside the border. Marked with a red line on Dynmap
* :no\_pedestrians:**No World Griefing**: Avoid intentional large-scale environmental damage, like forest fires or lavacasting, as examples, to preserve the shared game world.
* **No Active Redstone:** Additionally, passive redstone is accepted for more general (non-farm) use cases, so long it doesn't affect the server considerably. In cases of uncertainty, request guidance from an admin. Creating or using lag machines, whether using redstone or not, is strictly prohibited.
