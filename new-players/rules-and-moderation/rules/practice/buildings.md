# 4. Buildings

A page that provides more information about the rules in the section for buildings and other constructions.

### 4.1 Vandalism

Vandalism, including the placement of annoying blocks, large-scale griefing, and destructive use of fluids like lava and water, is generally prohibited. Destruction of unclaimed areas is allowed, but claimed towns and structures are protected from significant damage. However, during a formally declared war, some griefing is permitted under specific conditions, focusing on strategic objectives rather than total destruction. Post-war rebuilding and reparations are encouraged to maintain server harmony.

**4.1.1 No Placement of Annoying Blocks:** Placing blocks, such as dirt, cobblestone, or other unwanted materials, around or near towns, buildings, or other playersâ€™ structures with the intent to annoy, clutter, or disrupt the aesthetic of the environment is prohibited, except in cases outlined under the War Exception rule.

**4.1.2 Prohibition of Large-Scale Griefing:** Large-scale griefing, including but not limited to, lava casting, water flooding, or any actions intended to cause widespread destruction or defacement of claimed land, is against the rules. This applies to both towns and other player-owned structures, with exceptions noted under the War Exception rule.

**4.1.3 Fluid Placement Restrictions:** The intentional placement of fluids, such as lava or water, outside of personal or town boundaries to cause harm, destruction, or to grief other players is strictly forbidden, except as allowed under the War Exception rule.

**4.1.4 Protection of Claimed Areas:** While destroying unclaimed structures is allowed, players must respect claimed towns and structures. Destroying or significantly damaging an **entire** claimed town or its essential structures is against the rules unless the actions fall within the War Exception.

**4.1.5 War Exception:**

* **War Declaration:** If two or more nations formally declare war, some forms of griefing are permitted during the conflict. This includes limited destruction of enemy infrastructure, strategic placement of blocks and fluids, and other war-related activities.
* **Scope of Destruction:** Griefing under the War Exception must still be within reason. Total destruction of towns or obliteration of all infrastructure is prohibited. Actions should focus on strategic military objectives, such as disabling defenses, blocking routes, or damaging specific structures.
* **Post-War Rebuilding:** After the conflict, the victorious nation is encouraged to assist in rebuilding or provide reparations to the defeated nation. This helps maintain long-term server harmony and ensures that war does not permanently damage the server's landscape.
* **War Notification:** Nations must publicly declare war in a recognized server channel or forum before any war-related actions are taken. This ensures all players are aware of the conflict and its rules.
* **War Council Oversight:** A neutral War Council, consisting of moderators or trusted community members, may oversee the conflict to ensure that all actions remain within the agreed-upon rules and do not escalate into excessive griefing.
* **Consequences for Vandalism:**
  * Any form of vandalism outside of the War Exception, whether minor (e.g., placing annoying blocks) or major (e.g., large-scale griefing), will result in disciplinary actions. This can include temporary bans, removal of offending materials, and, in severe cases, permanent bans.

### 4.2 Unlawful engineering work

&#x20;Farm with ladders/vines: Using ladders/vines at edges in farms to prevent entity-cramming is prohibited.

Downward farm: It is okay to harvest all the downwards in a farm simultaneously using water buckets in a dispenser activated by a lever or a button.

### 4.4 Unlawful aircraft

&#x20;It is only allowed to build machines (aircraft) in controlled forms if they meet certain criteria:

* The machine must have stop blocks in the form of obsidian or furnaces at both start and stop.
* The machine may only be built on town land and on a plot intended for the machine.
* The entire path of the machine must be visible to the player (so one must be able to see the entire way between start and stop).
* The machine must not be able to change its flight direction, nor have the ability to do so with player involvement, for example, by pressing a button.

Moderators have the right to dismantle a machine they believe may threaten any building on the server or otherwise go against the above guidelines. The moderator also has no obligation to return materials from a machine that is considered to violate the rule.

### 4.6 Redstone Rules

* Passive and Active redstone farms

Active redstone machines are not allowed; however, passive machines are permitted with restrictions. They must not exceed 2 chunks in size, be stacked higher than 2 units, and should only be activated by observers, daylight sensors, or a player. Avoid constant activation of triggers, as it is considered active redstone

* &#x20;Large scale redstone farms

Each town allows only one large-scale farm (except for bamboo and kelp farms), limited to 5 by 5 chunks on a single layer. Redstone components must stay within 20% of the total farm area and operate solely on player-initiated power. Prohibited are redstone clocks, daylight sensors, and continuous triggers; instead, a button press initiates one cycle of operation.

* Redstone machinery

Non-farm-related redstone machines are welcome, provided they don't put undue strain on the server.

**Limit the Use of Pistons and Hoppers:** Excessive use of pistons, especially in rapid succession, can create lag. Hoppers should be used thoughtfully, with item filters and systems designed to minimize the number of active hoppers at any given time.
