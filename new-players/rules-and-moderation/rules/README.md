# Rules for Nordics

Disclaimer: The extent of penalties for rule violations will consider factors such as the duration of the offence and the benefits gained. Individuals who have not extensively contravened the rules or derived significant advantages from their actions may receive less severe penalties.

## 1. **Cheating and Technical Issues**&#x20;

**1.1 Use of Cheats:** Those who use any form of cheats, mods, or programs that provide unfair advantages in the game will be convicted of cheating. This includes, but is not limited to, resource and texture packs that conceal certain blocks, speed and flight cheats, and x-ray. Those caught using these will face severe penalties.

**1.1.1 Unauthorized Automation:** Those who use functions to automatically create mouse clicks, movements, keyboard presses, or any other form of automated behavior that may provide advantages will be convicted of unauthorized automation.

**1.2 Assisting in Cheating:** Those who collaborate or trade with players where it is evident that the other player is breaking the prohibition in the previous section will be convicted of assisting in cheating.

**1.3 Exploitation of technical issues or bugs:** Players who discover a bug or unintended feature must report it immediately to the server admins or moderators and must not use it for personal gain. Exploiting such issues, whether known or unknown to the public or the server staff, will result in severe penalties. This rule also applies to players who attempt to use another player's account to bypass bans or suspensions.

**1.4 Multi-Accounting:** Those who **exploit** multiple accounts to generate in-game currency on the server will be convicted of multi-accounting.

## 2. Behaviors

&#x20;**2.1 Deception:** Those who intentionally deceive or otherwise knowingly or negligently deceive other players will be convicted of deception. This also applies to those who unlawfully attempt to mimic another player's or moderator's identity or other characteristics on the server.

**2.2 Disobedience to Authority:** Anyone who does not follow the written instructions of the serving moderator is convicted of disobedience against the authorities. Even those who ignore a moderator are convicted of disobedience against the authorities. This applies to both Discord and the server.

**2.3 Incitement to violate rules.** Anyone who incites other players to commit a rule violation is judged for incitement to violate rules.

## 3. Communication channels

**3.1 Inappropriate language use:**  Those who choose careless, inappropriate, unsuitable, or foreign words are judged for inappropriate language use. This includes, but is not limited to, chat, private messages, player names, naming of items, plots and towns, the website, and Discord. By foreign language use, it refers to text written in languages other than Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and English, or languages in a dialect that differs significantly from the common language.

**3.2 Provocation:** Those who intentionally express xenophobia, hatred, threats, sexual innuendos, or revenge are judged for provocation. This includes, but is not limited to, expressions in writing and constructions.

**3.3 Spam:** Anyone who repeats many similar messages in a short time or sends junk messages in any of Nordic's communication channels is judged for spam.

**3.4 Advertising violation:** Those who advertise in order to invite players to another server are judged for advertising violation. Also, those who intentionally use Nordics for commercial purposes are judged for advertising violation.

**3.5 Unlawful opposition:** Those who openly criticize the server, or its moderators in a non-constructive manner are judged for unlawful opposition.

**3.6 Personal data violation:** Those who spread personal information are judged for personal data violation. This includes, among other things, social security numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and accounts. It is also not okay to spread other players' account IDs or login information. Even those who repeatedly request other players' personal information/accounts despite being denied are judged for personal data violation.

## 4. Buildings and other constructions

&#x20;**4.1 Vandalism:** Vandalism, including the placement of annoying blocks, large-scale griefing, and destructive use of fluids like lava and water, is generally prohibited. Destruction of unclaimed areas is allowed, but claimed towns and structures are protected from significant damage. However, during a formally declared war, some griefing is permitted under specific conditions, focusing on strategic objectives rather than total destruction. Post-war rebuilding and reparations are encouraged to maintain server harmony.

**4.2 Unauthorized engineering work:** Anyone who constructs or uses farms where nether wart is automatically planted or harvested is judged for unauthorized engineering work. Unauthorized engineering work also applies to those who build redstone circuits, elytra cannons, or other constructions that noticeably negatively affect the server's performance.&#x20;

**4.3 Unauthorized construction:** Intentionally constructs a trap, an arena, or other structure to harm or kill players in a **public** town Those who construct something that meets the criteria for "3.1 inappropriate language use" or "3.2 provocation" are judged for either unauthorized construction, inappropriate language use, or provocation.

**4.4 Unauthorized aircraft:** Anyone who builds or uses aircraft that do not meet the requirements for building aircraft is judged for building or using unauthorized aircraft.

### 4.6 Redstone rules:&#x20;

**4.6.1 Avoid Excessive Redstone Clocks:** Continuous redstone clocks or circuits that run indefinitely can cause significant lag. Players should design circuits that deactivate when not in use or utilize observer-based or delay-based timers to minimize server load.

**4.6.2 Use Chunk-Aligned Builds:** Each town allows only one large-scale farm (except for bamboo and kelp farms), limited to 5 by 5 chunks on a single layer. Redstone components must stay within 20% of the total farm area and operate solely on player-initiated power. Prohibited are redstone clocks, daylight sensors, and continuous triggers; instead, a button press initiates one cycle of operation.

**4.6.3 Avoid Automatic Farms That Run Continuously:** Automatic farms that run continuously, especially those that generate large amounts of entities (e.g., mob farms, crop farms), should be limited or designed with on/off switches to reduce lag.

**4.6.4 No Exploitative Redstone:**Any use of redstone intended to exploit game mechanics, duplicate items, or otherwise gain an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited. This includes machines designed to overload the server or bypass intended game limitations.

**4.6.5 Responsibility for Redstone Lag:** Players are responsible for ensuring their redstone builds do not negatively impact server performance. If a redstone creation is found to cause significant lag, players may be asked to modify or remove it.

## **7. Fair Play**

&#x20;7.1 Combat Logging: Logging out during combat to avoid dying or losing items is prohibited. Players caught combat logging will face penalties. 7.2 Scamming: Deliberately scamming other players in trades or agreements is forbidden. All trades should be conducted fairly and transparently.

## **8. Economy and Trade**

**8.1 Exploiting Market Bugs:** Exploiting bugs or glitches in the server's economy or trade systems to gain an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, item duplication or exploiting pricing errors.&#x20;

## **9. Events and Competitions**

&#x20;**9.1 Cheating in Events:** Any form of cheating or unfair advantage in server-hosted events or competitions is prohibited. This includes using unauthorized mods, exploiting event mechanics, or colluding with other players to manipulate outcomes.&#x20;

**9.2 Event Disruption**: Intentionally disrupting server events, including griefing event areas, sabotaging other players, or otherwise hindering the event's operation, is not allowed.
