# SwineFeather

***

**About me:**

> Greetings, this is Alexander but also known as SwineFeather and Aytte. I'm deeply commited in my role as the manager of the Nordics server as it's been a long-standing desire since I started playing Minecraft. My love for learning has been a guiding force in my life, and I have eagerly pursued new knowledge and skills, particularly in the realms of visual effects and 3D. This passion was kindled from the moment I first laid hands on a computer, and since then, I have wholeheartedly delved into various creative pursuits, constantly seeking to expand my base knowledge. Writing and typing is something I've underlooked as a teenager. Now I understand the importance of writing skills and typing fast and efficient. My goal is to reach at least 180wpm in 60sec: [https://monkeytype.com/profile/SwineFeather](https://monkeytype.com/profile/SwineFeather)

> Although I currently work as a construction worker, I'm yearning towards transitioning into self-employment as a risky investment into the future.
