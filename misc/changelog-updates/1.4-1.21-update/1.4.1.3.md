## Dynmap performance, it had 6% strain on server.

DYNMAP ENHANCES:\
How often a tile gets rendered (in seconds).

renderinterval: 8 (From 1 to 8)

Default delay on processing of updated tiles, in seconds. This can reduce potentially expensive re-rendering

of frequently updated tiles (such as due to machines, pistons, quarries or other automation). Values can

also be set on individual worlds and individual maps.

tileupdatedelay: 80 (From 30 to 80)\
\
tiles-rendered-at-once: 1 (From 2 to 1)\
\
renderaccelerateinterval: 2 (from 0.2)\
\
