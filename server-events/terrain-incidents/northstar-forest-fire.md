# ðŸ”¥ Northstar Forest Fire

Much of the destruction can be seen on the server map found here: [http://map.nordics.world/](http://map.nordics.world/) or here: [http://nordics.world:3200/](http://nordics.world:3200/)

### The Beginning

On the evening of May 19, 2024, [Volymskala](../../the-world/civilization/players/volymskala.md) alerted the current players on the server to a fire that had just started spreading in the forest surrounding the town of [Northstar](../../the-world/civilization/towns/northstar/). As a fellow citizen of [Constellation](../../the-world/civilization/nations/constellation.md), [\_Bamson](../../the-world/civilization/players/\_bamson.md) answered the call.

The fire, likely ignited by a recent thunderstorm, proved unquenchable despite their frantic efforts. As the fire continued to spread, they decided to unload the chunks and wait until more people could help to put it out.

The fire continued to rage in the forest outside of [Northstar](../../the-world/civilization/towns/northstar/), and the players grew weary of the destruction it caused. Progress was slow, and it took until May 22 before [\_Bamson ](../../the-world/civilization/players/\_bamson.md)and [Aytte ](../../the-world/civilization/players/aytte.md)decided that the fire had to be stopped.

### The Solution

In the planning phase, they decided to construct two firebreaks in hopes of containing the fire. [\_Bamson ](../../the-world/civilization/players/\_bamson.md)and [Aytte ](../../the-world/civilization/players/aytte.md)prioritized the south firebreak, designing it to follow a natural river to aid in its construction.

As they fought against the clock, seeing the fire moving closer, they worked tirelessly. However, when they reached the end of the firebreak and turned back, they discovered that the fire had slipped past in the high grass along the firebreak. This was a significant setback, as they had already invested a lot of time and effort.

Despite this, their spirits were not crushed. After regrouping and drafting a new plan for a second south firebreak, they went to work again. This time, they were joined by [CrispyChickes](../../the-world/civilization/players/crispychickes.md), another player from the nation of [Constellation](../../the-world/civilization/nations/constellation.md). The new firebreak was built much wider and cleared of all grass. With careful observation, they finally stopped the fire to the south.

### The Result

With [CrispyChickes](../../the-world/civilization/players/crispychickes.md)' help, the work progressed quickly. The three players managed to create a second north firebreak in time to stop the fire from spreading north. The initial north firebreak left a lot of forest between itself and the fire, so with the fire under control but not extinguished, [Aytte ](../../the-world/civilization/players/aytte.md)decided on May 23 to create a second north firebreak closer to the actual fire. This decision saved a significant portion of the forest.

By the end of May 23, the last pockets of fire were extinguished, allowing the players to assess the devastation. Around a third of the forest in the [Swedish region](../../the-world/civilization/towns/archived-towns/sweden-region.md) was destroyed.
