#### **Fishing Mechanics Guide** for Docs

In our fishing system, catching fish requires timing and precision. Here’s how it works:

1. **The Fishing Bar**:
   * A bar with **10 boxes** appears on the screen. One of the boxes is **highlighted** and moves back and forth across the bar.
   * Players must time their actions to hit the **green box** that appears randomly. This is the target for catching the fish.
2. **Health and Hits**:
   * Each successful hit reduces the fish’s health by 1.
   * Fish health ranges from **1 to 5** for most fish, with **exceptional fish** (such as Legendary and Mythical tiers) having up to **10 health**.
   * The **Serpentvine Streamer**, for example, has **6 health**, making it a tough but achievable catch.
3. **Lives**:
   * Players start with **2 lives**. Missing a green box causes the player to lose a life.
   * If both lives are lost, the fish escapes, and the player must try again.
4. **Difficulty Scaling**:
   * The **speed of the highlighted box** increases based on the rarity of the fish. For **Common** and **Rare** fish, the speed is manageable, but for **Legendary** and **Mythical** fish, the box moves much faster, requiring more precise timing and skill.
