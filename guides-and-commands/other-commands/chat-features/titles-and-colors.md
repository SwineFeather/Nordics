## **Setting Your Towny Title and Surname**

To set your **title** and **surname** using the Towny plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Setting Your Title**\
   The title appears before your name and can be customized by the mayor or a higher-ranking player.
   * **Command**: `/town set title [player] [title]`
   * **Example**: `/town set title Aytte Mayor`
   * This will make the player "Aytte" display as "Mayor Aytte" in chat.
2. **Setting Your Surname**\
   The surname appears after your name and can also be set by the mayor or a higher-ranking player.
   * **Command**: `/town set surname [player] [surname]`
   * **Example**: `/town set surname Aytte theBrave`
   * This will make the player "Aytte" display as "Aytte theBrave" in chat.

## **Adding Colors to Titles and Surnames**

Towny allows the use of Minecraft’s color codes to customize titles and surnames. To add color, you can use the Minecraft color codes, which consist of an `&` symbol followed by a character. For example, `&6` will give gold color.

Here’s how you can add colors:

1. **Colors in Titles**
   * **Command**: `/town set title [player] [title]`
   * **Example**: `/town set title Aytte &6Mayor`
   * This will display "Mayor Aytte" in gold.
2. **Colors in Surnames**
   * **Command**: `/town set surname [player] [surname]`
   * **Example**: `/town set surname Aytte &cTheBrave`
   * This will display "Aytte TheBrave" with the surname in red.

## **Minecraft Color Codes**

Here’s a list of Minecraft’s basic color codes that you can use:

* **&0** - Black
* **&1** - Dark Blue
* **&2** - Dark Green
* **&3** - Dark Aqua
* **&4** - Dark Red
* **&5** - Dark Purple
* **&6** - Gold
* **&7** - Gray
* **&8** - Dark Gray
* **&9** - Blue
* **\&a** - Green
* **\&b** - Aqua
* **\&c** - Red

## **Example of a Fully Customized Name**

Let’s say you want the name to appear as "**Mayor Aytte the Brave**," where "Mayor" is gold, "Aytte" remains the default color, and "the Brave" is red:

* **Command for Title**: `/town set title Aytte &6Mayor`
* **Command for Surname**: `/town set surname Aytte &cthe Brave`

This will result in: **Mayor Aytte the Brave** with "Mayor" in gold and "the Brave" in red.

## **Resetting Titles and Surnames**

To remove a title or surname, use the following commands:

* **Remove Title**: `/town set title [player] none`
* **Remove Surname**: `/town set surname [player] none`
