# Sign Shops

#### Step 1: Place the chest&#x20;

Start by placing the chest somewhere on a plot you own.&#x20;

#### Step 2: Left-Click the chest

Left-Click the chest with the item you want to sell in your hand. Then type in the `chat`  what you would like the `price per item` to be.

#### Step 3: Restock the shop

&#x20;If everything went well, you should now have a shop that sells a diamond for 250 euros. You can then restock the shop's inventory by placing the remaining 63 diamonds in the chest.
