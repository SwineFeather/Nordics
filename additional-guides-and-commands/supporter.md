# Patreon/Supporter Benefits & Cosmetics

## **Minecraft Patron Benefits:**

* When you become a Patron supporter, you gain access to exclusive cosmetics that are yours to keep forever. Each month, we refresh the pool of bonus cosmetics available to active supporters. Here’s how it works:
  * 🔒 **Permanent Cosmetics:** Once you become a supporter, any cosmetics in the current pool for your support tier are permanently added to your account. These are yours to keep even if you decide to stop supporting in the future.
  * ✨ **Monthly Cosmetic Pool:** Every month, a new set of cosmetics is added to the pool. If you’re an active supporter during that month, you’ll receive these new items as part of your benefits. However, if you stop supporting, you won’t receive the new cosmetics from subsequent months.
  * 🗝️ **Treasure Chests:** Even if you’re no longer a supporter or if you missed out on certain cosmetics from a previous month, you can still obtain them by purchasing and unboxing Treasure Chests from the `/uc menu`. All cosmetics that have ever been in the pool remain available through this method.
  * 🔒 **Standard Cosmetics:** In addition to the monthly bonuses, there are standard cosmetics that are always available to supporters. These include exclusive pets, particle effects, mounts, and more, which you can access anytime as long as you’re a supporter.
  * ~~🎁 **Milestone Rewards:** Every 3 months of support earns you a special gift, increasing in value with your support tier—Kala, Fancy Kala, or Golden Kala. From unique titles to custom mounts, your dedication is rewarded at each milestone.~~  <mark style="color:red;">**W.I.P**</mark>
