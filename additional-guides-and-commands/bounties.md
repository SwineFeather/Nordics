# Bounties

### Setting Bounties <a href="#setting-bounties" id="setting-bounties"></a>

Before creating a bounty, you need to decide on the following:

* **Who** to set the bounty on (the **target**)
  * _The target cannot be a friendly player._
* What items should be given(the **reward**)
* Whether the bounty should be anonymous (silent-raise)

&#x20;

Once you have decided, type:

* `/bounty raise <player>` **sets a bounty** on a player. (_Only items_)
* `/bounty list` Displays the list of active bounties.
* `/bounty silentraise <player>` Raises the bounty for a player, hiding the benefactor's identity.
* `/bounty reset <player>`removes a player's bounty.

#### ~~Bounty Expiry~~ <a href="#bounty-expiry" id="bounty-expiry"></a>

~~Bounties expire naturally if either the bounty creator or target do not login for 90 days. They also expire if they are only available to a specific town or nation which is then deleted. Expired bounties return their reward money to their creator.~~
