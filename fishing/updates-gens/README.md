## **Generation Releases (Every 6 Months)**

A **Generation** marks a significant update with noticeable changes, new mechanics, and a fresh set of fish for players to explore. Hereâ€™s what a Generation release should include:

**Generation Structure:**

1. **New Fish**:
   * Introduce **3 new fish per biome**, ensuring that all biomes feel refreshed and have new species to catch.
   * Focus on balancing between different fish tiers (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, etc.).
2. **New Fishing Rods/Items**:
   * Release **new fishing rods**, possibly tied to specific biomes or tiers.
   * Add **new items** that enhance the fishing experience (e.g., better bait, cosmetic items, or special tools).
3. **GUI Enhancements**:
   * A **visual update** to the fishing interface to make the new generation feel distinct (e.g., new menus, better tracking of caught fish, updated Fishdex).
   * New **icons** or badges to represent the generation change (e.g., Gen 1 badge next to all fish from this generation).
4. **Special Mechanics or Features**:
   * Consider introducing **new mechanics** like rare weather-based catches, evolving quests tied to fishing, or biome-specific challenges.
   * **Tournaments** tied to the generation launch, where players compete to catch the new fish.
5. **Thematic Focus**:
   * With each generation, one **biome** or **fishing aspect** gets a special focus or revamp. For example, **Generation 2** could focus on the **Desert Biome**, adding special fish, new terrain challenges, or unique tournament mechanics tied to the desert.

## **Bi-Monthly Updates (Between Generations, Every 2 Months)**

These smaller updates will keep the excitement going between major Generations, keeping players engaged and encouraging them to explore specific biomes or participate in events.

**Bi-Monthly Update Structure:**

1. **Biome-Specific Fish Additions**:
   * Add **1-3 new fish** to a specific biome that needs attention (e.g., if no one is fishing in the Desert Biome, add 3 new Desert fish from the current generation to encourage activity there).
   * These smaller additions can help balance and maintain excitement across all biomes.
2. **Mini-Tournaments or Competitions**:
   * Introduce **small tournaments** tied to the new fish or biome. For example, after releasing 3 new Desert fish, run a **Desert Fishing Tournament** where players compete to catch the rarest desert species.
   * Offer rewards tied to the current generation (e.g., exclusive titles, items, or temporary boosts).
3. **Events/Challenges**:
   * Run **biome-specific events**, like a **Mushroom Biome Exploration Week**, where certain biomes offer increased catch rates, special fish, or other incentives.
4. **Community Feedback Adjustments**:
   * If certain fish are less popular or a biome isn't being explored, use this time to adjust fish spawn rates, add new fish, or introduce **balance patches** based on player feedback.
