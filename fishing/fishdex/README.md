#### **Fish Stats Overview**

Each fish you encounter has its own unique set of stats that determine how difficult it is to catch, the rewards for catching it, and other key attributes. Here’s a breakdown of what these stats represent:

***

1. **Catch Chance**
   * **Description**: The probability of catching the fish based on its rarity. Rare and legendary fish have a lower catch chance, making them more elusive.
   * **What You Should Know**: Higher-tier fish, like Mythical or Legendary, are harder to catch due to their low chance. The catch chance can be affected by factors such as bait or your level.
2. **Fish Health**
   * **Description**: The amount of correct hits required to successfully catch the fish. This stat represents the fish’s resilience and how challenging it is to reel in.
   * **What You Should Know**: More powerful or legendary fish will have higher health, meaning you need to perform more accurate actions to catch them.
3. **Experience (XP)**
   * **Description**: The amount of experience you gain from catching the fish. Fish with higher rarity yield more XP.
   * **What You Should Know**: Legendary and Mythical fish offer the most XP, which helps you level up faster in your fishing rank.
4. **Weight**
   * **Description**: The average weight of the fish. Larger fish tend to be more valuable and harder to catch.
   * **What You Should Know**: Weight can influence the price you receive when selling the fish, as well as the bragging rights for catching larger specimens.
5. **Price**
   * **Description**: The monetary value of the fish when sold. Higher-tier and larger fish fetch a higher price.
   * **What You Should Know**: Legendary and Mythical fish often sell for much more than Common or Rare fish due to their rarity and size.
6. **Level Requirement**
   * **Description**: The level or rank you need to be in order to have a chance at catching the fish. Higher-tier fish require more experience and skill to catch.
   * **What You Should Know**: Some fish are locked behind level thresholds, meaning you’ll need to increase your fishing level to encounter them in the wild.
