# Gurnard

Gurnard fish are found primarily in temperate and tropical marine waters worldwide, often in shallow coastal regions. They prefer sandy or muddy seabeds where they can search for crustaceans and small fish. Here are common locations for gurnard species:

1. **Eastern Atlantic Ocean**: Many gurnard species, including the red gurnard, are found along the coasts of Europe, from Norway to the Mediterranean Sea and the northwest coast of Africa.
2. **Mediterranean Sea**: Several species thrive in the warmer waters of the Mediterranean, where they inhabit shallow sandy areas.
3. **Indian Ocean**: Inhabiting the coasts around Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of South Asia, some gurnard species are also present in these tropical waters.
4. **Pacific Ocean**: Gurnards are found along the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, particularly in sandy bays and estuaries.

Known for their colorful pectoral fins, gurnards use them to "walk" along the ocean floor as they search for food
