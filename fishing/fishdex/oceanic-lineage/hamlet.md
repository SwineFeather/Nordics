# Hamlet

The Hamlet fish, primarily the **Indigo Hamlet** and other colorful varieties, are typically found in the **Caribbean Sea** and surrounding waters. Here are key areas where they are commonly located:

1. **Caribbean Islands**: Hamlet fish inhabit coral reefs and rocky coastal regions near islands such as the Bahamas, Jamaica, and the Virgin Islands.
2. **Gulf of Mexico**: They are occasionally spotted along the reefs and shallow coastal waters of the Gulf, near places like Florida and the Yucat√°n Peninsula.
3. **Western Atlantic Ocean**: Hamlet fish are found along the Atlantic coasts of Central and South America, particularly near Belize, Honduras, and parts of Venezuela.

Hamlets are reef fish and prefer clear, shallow waters where they can hunt for small crustaceans and blend into coral structures.
