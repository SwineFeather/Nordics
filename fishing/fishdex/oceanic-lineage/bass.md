# Bass

**Bass** are widely distributed, particularly in freshwater and coastal environments, and can be found in both North America and globally, depending on the type of bass. Here’s a breakdown of where they’re typically found:

1. **Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass**:
   * **North America**: These freshwater species are native to North America and are commonly found in lakes, rivers, and ponds across the United States and Canada.
   * **Largemouth Bass**: Prefer warmer, shallow waters with lots of vegetation and are particularly common in the southeastern U.S.
   * **Smallmouth Bass**: Often found in cooler, clearer rivers and lakes, especially in the northeastern and midwestern U.S.
2. **Sea Bass**:
   * **North Atlantic Ocean**: Sea bass species, such as black sea bass, are found in coastal waters along the eastern United States, from New England to Florida.
   * **Pacific Ocean**: Some bass, like the kelp bass, are common along the west coast of North America, particularly near kelp forests in California waters.

#### Ideal Minecraft Biome for Bass

In Minecraft, bass would best fit the following biomes:

1. **River Biome**: Freshwater bass (like largemouth and smallmouth bass) would naturally fit in river biomes, where players could encounter them while exploring or fishing in freshwater.
2. **Warm Ocean Biome**: Sea bass would be well-suited to warmer ocean biomes, especially around coral reefs or sandy beaches, providing a diverse ocean habitat.
3. **Swamp Biome**: Largemouth bass could thrive here due to the murky, vegetation-rich waters that mimic their real-world habitats, giving the swamp biome a bit more life and realism.

These choices would help reflect bass’s real-world habitat in Minecraft, adding variety to rivers and oceans in the game.
