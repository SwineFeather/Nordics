# Herring

Herring are found in various parts of the world's oceans, primarily in colder, temperate waters. Here are the main regions where different species of herring are commonly found:

1. **North Atlantic Ocean**: The Atlantic herring, one of the most widespread species, inhabits waters off the coasts of North America and Europe. In North America, they are common from the Gulf of Maine to Labrador. In Europe, they are found from the Baltic Sea to the coastlines of Norway and the British Isles.
2. **North Pacific Ocean**: The Pacific herring is abundant along the coasts of North America, from California up to Alaska, and across the Pacific to Russia and Japan.
3. **Baltic Sea and North Sea**: Herring thrive in the cooler waters of the Baltic and North Seas, providing an essential part of the local fishing industry.

Herring prefer coastal areas with plankton-rich waters, where they can form large schools, often migrating seasonally to breed in shallower waters. These migrations make them a crucial food source for various marine species and coastal communities.
