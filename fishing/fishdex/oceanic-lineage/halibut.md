# Halibut

Halibut are large flatfish found in cold, northern ocean waters, particularly in the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Here are the main regions:

1. **North Pacific Ocean**: The Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) ranges along the west coast of North America from California up to Alaska and across to eastern Russia and Japan.
2. **North Atlantic Ocean**: The Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) is found in the cold waters around Greenland, Iceland, and along the coasts of Norway, the United Kingdom, and parts of eastern Canada and the northeastern United States.

Halibut prefer deep waters, typically between 50 to 2,000 feet, and are often found near continental shelf edges and deep underwater slopes. These habitats offer them ample prey and protection as they blend in with the ocean floor.
