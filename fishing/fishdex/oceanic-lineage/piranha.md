# Piranha

Hemopiranha

Piranhas are primarily found in **South American freshwater rivers and lakes**, especially in tropical areas. Here are key regions where they are commonly found:

1. **Amazon Basin**: The Amazon River and its tributaries are home to many piranha species, particularly in Brazil, Peru, and surrounding countries.
2. **Orinoco River Basin**: In Venezuela and Colombia, piranhas inhabit the Orinoco River and nearby waters.
3. **Paran√° River Basin**: Some piranhas are found in the rivers of Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay.
4. **Guyana Shield Rivers**: These rivers in northern South America, such as those in Guyana and Suriname, also host piranhas.

Piranhas prefer warm, slow-moving rivers or floodplains with dense vegetation, where they can find cover and hunt. While they are often depicted as highly aggressive, only certain species show intense feeding behaviors.
