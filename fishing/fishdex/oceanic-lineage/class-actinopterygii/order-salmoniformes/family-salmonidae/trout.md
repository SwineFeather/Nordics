# Trout

**Trout** are freshwater fish in the salmonid family, found in cool, clean rivers and lakes across the **Northern Hemisphere**. Here’s where they commonly occur:

1. **North America**: The rainbow trout, native to the western United States, is widely distributed in rivers, streams, and lakes across North America. The brook trout and lake trout are also common in Canada, the northeastern U.S., and mountainous regions.
2. **Europe and Asia**: Brown trout are native to Europe and parts of Asia and have been introduced to many rivers and lakes worldwide. They’re particularly common in the UK, Scandinavia, and central Europe.
3. **Mountain Streams and Lakes**: Trout thrive in cold, oxygen-rich waters, often found in higher altitudes, including alpine lakes and fast-moving streams.

#### Ideal Minecraft Biome for Trout

For a Minecraft setting, trout would suit biomes that reflect their real-world preferences:

1. **River Biome**: The standard river biome would be a good choice, representing freshwater streams where trout naturally live.
2. **Mountain Biomes**: Trout could appear in high-altitude rivers or lakes near mountain biomes, which would reflect the cold, oxygenated waters they prefer.
3. **Cold Ocean Biome (for Lake Trout)**: Lake trout often inhabit cold, deep lakes, so the cold ocean biome could be an option for representing them.

These placements would simulate the trout’s habitat, bringing a realistic touch to Minecraft’s freshwater biomes.
