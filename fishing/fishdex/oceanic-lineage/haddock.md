# Haddock

Haddock are found in **cold North Atlantic waters**, particularly near the following regions:

1. **North Atlantic Ocean**: They are common along the eastern coast of North America, from Newfoundland to Cape Cod, as well as along the northern and western coasts of Europe, including the waters surrounding Iceland, the British Isles, Norway, and the Barents Sea.
2. **Depth and Habitat**: Haddock prefer deeper, cooler waters, typically ranging from 40 to 450 meters (130 to 1,480 feet) and are often found near sandy or gravel seabeds where they feed on small invertebrates.

#### Suitable Minecraft Biome for Haddock

In Minecraft, haddock would best fit in **Cold Ocean** and **Deep Ocean** biomes:

* **Cold Ocean Biome**: This biome aligns well with haddock's real-world cold water habitat, making it a natural choice for spawning.
* **Deep Ocean Biome**: Since haddock often inhabit deeper waters, the Deep Ocean biome could also be fitting, especially if the goal is to place them at greater depths for realism.

These biomes replicate the haddock's preference for cold, deep waters, enriching Minecraftâ€™s aquatic diversity while reflecting natural ecosystems.
