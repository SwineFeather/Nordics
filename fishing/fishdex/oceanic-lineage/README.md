# Oceanic Lineage

#### **Oceanic Lineage**

In the world of fishing, every fish belongs to a greater species lineage. Though their evolution is hidden in the depths of the ocean's lore, anglers can uncover and learn about these ancient transformations through their catches. The **Oceanic Lineage** reflects the natural progression of species, with each fish representing a step in its evolutionary history.

While there's no direct evolution between catches, each species hints at its past and future forms. For example, a common **Snapper** might be part of a greater lineage that includes the rare **Blossomtail Snapper** and the even more exotic **Flower Snapper**. Anglers can explore these lineages by discovering new fish and adding them to their catch catalog, unlocking their stories as they go.

Though your fishing adventure is powered by RNG, the joy of uncovering new species and understanding their place in the **Oceanic Lineage** gives a sense of continuity. Your catches will automatically populate the **Fishdex**, a category menu where you can track every fish youâ€™ve caught. As you explore, the species paths will fill out, giving you insight into the diverse aquatic life and the legendary lore that binds them.

This system creates a world where every catch is a new chapter in the ocean's story, waiting for players to piece together the lineages of their favorite species!
