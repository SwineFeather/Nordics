# Grouper

Grouper fish are widely found in warm ocean waters, typically inhabiting coral reefs and rocky coastal regions. Here are some specific locations:

1. **Atlantic Ocean**: Many species of grouper, like the Goliath Grouper, are common in the western Atlantic, ranging from the southeastern United States down to Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.
2. **Indian Ocean**: Groupers inhabit the waters around East Africa, India, and the Maldives.
3. **Pacific Ocean**: In the Indo-Pacific, they are abundant along the coral reefs of Australiaâ€™s Great Barrier Reef, Southeast Asia, and islands in the western and central Pacific.
4. **Mediterranean Sea**: Some grouper species also live in parts of the Mediterranean, particularly around the coastlines of southern Europe and North Africa.

Groupers prefer reef environments where they can use their robust bodies to navigate crevices and caves for hunting and protection.
