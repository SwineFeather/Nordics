# Cod

**Cod** are widely distributed in cold, northern ocean waters, particularly in the **North Atlantic Ocean**. Hereâ€™s where cod are commonly found:

1. **North Atlantic Ocean**: Atlantic cod inhabit coastal areas of the northern Atlantic, including waters off the coast of New England, Canada (particularly Newfoundland and Labrador), Greenland, and Europe (especially around Iceland, Norway, and the Barents Sea).
2. **North Pacific Ocean**: Pacific cod are found from the coastlines of Alaska down to Northern California and across to Russia and Japan.
3. **Deep and Shallow Coastal Areas**: Cod thrive in both deep ocean waters and coastal areas with rocky seabeds and kelp forests, where they find ample food and shelter.

#### Suitable Minecraft Biome for Cod

In Minecraft, cod already appear in various ocean biomes, which aligns well with their real-world distribution:

1. **Cold Ocean and Frozen Ocean Biomes**: These biomes suit cod well, as they mimic the cold northern waters where cod naturally thrive.
2. **Regular Ocean Biome**: In Minecraft, cod can also spawn in standard ocean biomes, which adds variety and accessibility for players in warmer waters.
3. **Deep Ocean Biome**: Deep ocean settings are ideal to simulate the colder, deeper parts of the ocean where cod are often found.
