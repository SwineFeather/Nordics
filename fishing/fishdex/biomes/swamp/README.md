# Swamp

**Swamp Biome**:

* **Goonch**, **Cichlid**, **Flapper** (potentially a fictional mudfish), **Crappie**, **Catfish**, **Tetra**, **Gramma**: Swamps are ideal for freshwater fish that thrive in murky, low-oxygen environments.
* **Alligator Gar**: This predatory fish is native to swampy or slow-moving waters, making the swamp biome perfect for it.
