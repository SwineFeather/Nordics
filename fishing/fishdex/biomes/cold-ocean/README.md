# Cold Ocean

**Cold Ocean Biome**:

* **Herring**, **Haddock**, **Halibut**, **Flounder**, **Cod**, **Turbot**, **Whiting**: Cold-water fish like herring, haddock, and cod are naturally found in cooler oceanic waters.
* **Squid** and **Eel**: These creatures are also versatile and found in deeper, colder waters.

**Frozen Ocean Biome**:

* **Plaice**, **Pouting/Pout**, **Scorpionfish**: Some cold-adapted species would be well-suited here, although many frozen ocean inhabitants are not common.

**Deep Ocean Biome**:

* **Anglerfish**, **Humpback Anglerfish**, **Swordfish**, **Alligator Gar**, **Porbeagle Shark**: Deep-sea and larger predatory fish would thrive here, including bioluminescent species like the anglerfish.
* **Shark**: Various shark species, especially those that thrive in deep waters, would make a perfect addition to the deep ocean.
