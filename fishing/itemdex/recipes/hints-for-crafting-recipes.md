# Hints for Crafting Recipes

#### **Hints for Crafting Recipes**

Unlocking the secrets of fish crafting recipes will require more than just catching the right fish. Players must gather **clues** from a variety of sources within the game world. These hints will lead them closer to understanding how to craft powerful items like **Scales**, armor, and special tools. Here are some ways players can discover these hints:

**1. Fish Catches**

When players catch rare or legendary fish, subtle clues can be found within the **item description**. This could be a short message hinting at the fish’s potential use.

* **Example**:
  * Upon catching a **Scorched Sunfish**, the item’s description could include:
    * “The scales radiate with heat, but their true potential remains hidden…”
  * This teases the idea that the fish’s scales may have fire-related crafting potential.

**2. Treasure Chest Drops**

Players may find **ancient scrolls** or **fragments of notes** in treasure chests that hint at crafting recipes. These scrolls could offer riddles or cryptic descriptions of what’s needed.

* **Example**:
  * “In the icy depths where shadows dwell, lies a fish whose scales can turn frost into protection. Seek it under the frozen moon.”
  * This note hints at using fish from the **Cold Ocean Biome** to craft frost-resistant armor.

**3. Special Drops or Artifacts**

Certain rare **artifacts** or **unique drops** from other mobs could contain lore or inscriptions that reveal secrets of crafting. These could be rare items that are not essential for crafting but provide important context or unlock recipes once combined with a fish.

* **Example**:
  * An item called **“Ancient Carver’s Tool”** could drop from a rare chest or mob, and its description might read:
    * “Once used to craft scales of legend. Only fish of divine nature will respond.”
  * This would indicate that combining this artifact with a **Divine-tier fish** unlocks a new crafting recipe.

**4. NPC Dialogues or Lore**

In the future, **lore-based NPCs** or books scattered in key locations could drop hints about recipes. Players could discover hidden knowledge while exploring certain biomes, unlocking secrets about fish and their crafting uses.

* **Example**:
  * “The wild scales of the jungle hold more power than meets the eye. The trees whisper their secrets to those who listen.”
  * This would hint at a hidden jungle-related recipe for **Wild Scales**.

**5. Biome-Specific Clues**

Different biomes may contain **environmental clues** or small lore pieces that point toward specific crafting recipes. For instance, catching fish near certain landmarks or using specific bait in different areas could drop unique hints.

* **Example**:
  * “Near the heart of the swamp, ancient stones bear the markings of toxic craft. Could it be that the scales of swamp fish hold the key?”
  * This encourages players to explore the swamp biome for special crafting ingredients.
