## **Crafting Fish Scales with the Fishing Utility Table**

In the world of advanced fishing, some rare fish carry unique properties that can be extracted and used for crafting powerful items. At the **Fishing Utility Table**, players can transform certain fish into **Scales**, which hold the essence of the fish’s attributes. These scales can be used to craft armor, tools, and other special items.

## **How to Craft Scales:**

1. Place the fish in the **Fishing Utility Table**.
2. Select the **“Extract Scales”** option.
3. The table will convert the fish into a specific type of **Scale**, based on the fish's attributes.

## **Types of Scales by Biome**:

1. **Snow Biome**:
   * **Frost Scales**\
     These scales embody the freezing temperatures of the snow biome, providing cold resistance or frost-related abilities. Used for crafting armor or tools that excel in icy environments.
2. **Temperate Biome**:
   * **Vital Scales**\
     Fish from the temperate biomes produce scales rich in vitality and life force. These scales are essential for crafting items that grant health regeneration or vitality boosts.
3. **Swamp Biome**:
   * **Toxic Scales**\
     The murky waters of the swamp imbue fish with toxic properties. These scales are used to create armor or items that offer poison resistance or apply debuffs to enemies.
4. **Jungle Biome**:
   * **Wild Scales**\
     Jungle fish are wild and untamed, and their scales carry attributes that enhance speed, agility, or even resistance to natural threats. Items crafted from these scales may grant swiftness or jungle-related enhancements.
5. **Desert Biome**:
   * **Heat Scales**\
     Fish from the desert biome thrive in extreme heat. Their scales hold fire-resistant properties or can be used to create items that deal fire damage or provide heat resistance.

     Fish from caves have adapted to the darkness and vibrations of the underground. Their scales are used to create items with stealth properties or the ability to detect vibrations (enhancing awareness in dark environments).
9. **Deep Dark Biome**:
   * **Void Scales**\
     The mysterious and dangerous fish of the Deep Dark biome produce scales that seem to absorb light. Void Scales are used to craft powerful, shadow-related items, offering invisibility or darkness manipulation.
